"What are the theoretical and actual (measured) minimum water potentials in plants? <p>I'm a plant physiology researcher, but water potentials are not really my thing, so I don't have a great grasp on the literature. I'm dealing with water potential data right now though, and it seems questionable to me. Some of the measured water potential (solute + metric potentials, after lysing cells to break turgor) are as low as -48 bars (most in -10 to -35 range).</p>

<p>That would, if my math is correct, translate to a solute concentration in the 2000 mOsmol range, which seems extremely high to me. Consequently, I'm trying to determine if there is an analytic issue with the data collection. I've run through the equipment chain, checked calibrations, and everything seems ok. I've also been combing plant physiology lit. for comparable data, and I find some in that range, but I can't find any theoretical work that would help set a 'ceiling' for what constitutes a reasonable solute + metric potential.</p>

<p>So, my questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the theoretical maximum capacity for dissolved ion concentration in water, and what pressure potential would that represent, compared to pure water.</p></li>
<li><p>Is anyone aware of plant physiology research that has attempted to establish a minimum in vivo water potential in plants (either total potential, or S+M if it's broken out)?</p></li>

"Deciding a reasonable threshold for copy number variation in a CNV (SNP array) TCGA dataset <p>Is there a methodology to select a reasonable threshold for copy number variation in a CNV (SNP array) TCGA dataset, to define when there is a significative alteration?</p>

<p>Can I download CNV data for normal samples and take the 95th percentile of distribution? Are there better methods?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>This is the percentiles plot of the two distribution (Tumor vs Normal) of values, for the same technology (SNP array) and the same genome (hg19). </p>

<p>The tumor distribution has slightly more extreme values, though it is not enough in my opinion. For this reason I think I should not use a percentile score (the 5th and the 95th percentile of the normal samples distribution, for instance) to define the thresholds to call CNV alterations in the tumor samples.</p>

"All-or-nothing-law: law or general principle? <p>The all-or-nothing principle indicates that a nerve cell fires at maximum potential or not at all, based on a threshold on the stimulus.</p>

<p>Is this a statement which is always true, or only mostly-always true?</p>

<p>In electrical engineering, a discipline I have studied, we have a similar rule, a logic signal is responded to as though it is either a high or a low.  However, in the middle are what are known as ""metastable states,"" where the rules of thumb do not apply.  In fact, you can even theoretically lock up a logic circuit by presenting a steady stimulus in between two states.  Needless to say, designers of such circuits take great effort to ensure their logic is never exposed to such stimulus.</p>

<p>Do we have any evidence of neurons exhibiting behavior which defies the all-or-nothing law in some circumstances, or if not, what sorts of metastable behavior are seen when the stimulus is exceedingly close to that of the threshold?</p>

"How do plants 'tell time' for circadian rhythms based on a ~24 cycle? <p>I've read that many plants have some sort of circadian rhythm where they perform a certain action on a cycle of about 24 hours, like the mimosa plant opening and closing its leaves. Obviously this is done in order to synchronize with the sun, but many such plants continue to perform these actions even when left it constant darkness or light. It follows that this is the result of some sort of biochemical pathway, but whatever internal 'clock' is used is also independent of temperature. </p>

<p><strong>How can these plants perform certain actions every 24 hours at different temperatures when the chemical reactions most biochemical pathways use are temperature dependent?</strong></p>

<p>It would seem like the length of the cycle should vary widely according to the temperature as it affected the reactions involved, but instead it stays at a very constant length very close to 24 hours. How can this be? </p>

"How spermaceti makes a whale float <p>In the biochemistry book I'm reading (Box 10-1, Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry), an example is given in whales of how spermaceti (a wax located in the whale head), when at sea level is a liquid, and allows the whale to float due to its buoyancy. </p>

<p>As the whale dives deeper, the wax turns into a solid (due to the colder temperatures), and hence this more dense wax is less buoyant and prevents the whale from floating back up due to the greater density of the seawater at these depths.</p>

<p>My limited understanding is that density effects buoyancy in so far as that the weight of the object displaces an equivalent weight of water. If the quantity of the water displaced is small enough that the surface area of the object isn't completely submerged, it can float.</p>

<p>Now with the whale example, considering the wax is fully enclosed by the head, how would this change in local density effect the buoyancy of the whale as a whole? The weight of the wax still remains the same (in so far as the example used in the book), the only thing that changes is its density inside the whale.</p>

<p>So with a constant weight, and only a variable local density enclosed by an object (the head) and limited to these conditions only (as this is all the example in the book uses), how is this possible?</p>

"Why does the oral epithelium break and fall off when it is burned? <p>When you gobble up food that is too hot, you may damage the inside of your mouth cavity. More precisely speaking, I believe the mucous membrane lining the surface of your mouth cavity is damaged.</p>

<p>Following my protective instinct to lick around the damaged area with my tongue, I often feel that this damaged area is partly detached from the remaining undamaged whole of the membrane. If I try, I can pull the damaged area out with my fingers, as a pale sheet of skin. It is as if a part of the ceiling paint is detached and hanging; you can snap it off from the ceiling.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>why does the oral epithelium break and fall off when it is burned?</strong></p>

<p>My thought is that, since the mucous membrane lining the mouth is stratified squamous epithelium, like epidermis, a burn on the mucous membrane is comparable to a burn on the skin. Even so, I don't understand why the skin breaks and falls off when burned. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn#Pathophysiology"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> says, tissues at the epidermis break as proteins denature at high temperature. I am also not so sure why this occurs.

"What is the rationale for the complex eye structure? <p>The eye is a lens that focuses rays of light from a limited spectrum, after which the the image is turned over to the brain receptors that interpret it (beginning with turning it the right side up first, I think). </p>

<p>It is a complex and fragile instrument whose sole purpose is to pre-process the image ""mechanically"" (rather than ""electronically"") before turning it over to the ""CPU."" Please bear with me.</p>

<p>Most creatures who have one eye usually have another one as well. This second equally complex piece of hardware has, it would seem, two purposes: one, it serves as a spare; two, it allows its owner to see depth a bit better. (You can still see depth if you cover up one eye: your brain has to make a few adjustments, and a few more assumptions, but it's not like depth perception is completely gone, right?)</p>

<p>Now think of the original camera obscura (the one that had no lens, just a hole). By adjusting the size of the hole (aperture) one could make the resulting upside-down image on the opposite wall a bit sharper. The image is still a bit pale, but the subtle differences in color values would still be enough for a powerful computer (such as our brain) to work out the nuances.</p>

<p>Why would then God (or Evolution, for those who still believe in it) opt for making an infinitely complex piece of hardware (the eye) and then furnishing a backup as well, instead of just adding a few lines of code to the operating system?</p>

"Height and natural selection in humans? <p>I watched the documentary ""Evolve"" recently and in the segment on ""size"" Scott V. Edwards, Harvard evolutionary biologist mentioned the idea that humans might evolve to be 7' tall in 'hundreds of years'. (I think this may have been taken out of context... I have emailed him to find out, but do not expect a response from someone so busy)</p>

<p>The reasoning goes that the trend in the past 100 years has been greater height, and women show a strong preference for men who are taller than they are. (Though a large share perhaps all of this difference has been due to diets higher in protein at an early age) </p>

<p>I wonder, though, if this is only part of the story. The preference women have is not just for tall men, but for a man who is taller than she is. Likewise, men seem to prefer woman who are shorter than they are. There is even cultural pressure: the classic western image of a couple on wedding cake always shows a man who is about 4"" (to scale) taller than the bride.</p>

<p>Thus, women who are short have an advantage as they have a greater pool of men to choose from. (Colloquially, simply ask any 6' tall woman if she feels her height helps her find dates.) </p>

<p>Let's say that men seek women who are shorter than they are, but no more than 8"" shorter. Women seek men who are taller than they are but no more than 8"" taller. Given that the current average height for men is 5'8"" and for women it is 5'4"" (and distributed normally SD 2.8"") will we have selective pressure that leads to greater or lesser height?

Aggregate percentage is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>$AP_i = \frac{100\%}{N_y} \times \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{N}(\frac{a_{ij}}{\sum a_j})$</p>

<p>Where i is the i$^{th}$ taxon, j the j$^{th}$ sample, N total number of samples, a$_{ij}$ the abundance or mass of i$^{th}$ taxon in j$^{th}$ sample, and $\sum a_j$ the summed abundance or mass of all taxa in j$^{th}$ sample.</p>

"determining genome-wide exogenous binding of pathogens to host genome? <p>I've read <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2199"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> where they specifically modify a region in the rice genome to ablate the binding site of a pathogen, <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em>, and disrupt the hijacking of a gene network in the rice genome to the advantage of the pathogen.</p>

<p>It's an interesting concept but left me wondering how one would determine <em>de novo</em> the binding of these pathogen effectors into the host if one didn't know them. What would be the steps to determine where are the pathogen's TFs binding the host genome?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive
  cognitive decline and dementia in adults. While the amyloid cascade
  hypothesis of AD posits an initiating role for the β-amyloid (Aβ)
  protein, there is limited understanding of why Aβ is deposited. <strong>A
  growing body of evidence based on in vitro, animal studies and human
  imaging work suggests that synaptic activity increases Aβ, which is
  deposited preferentially in multimodal brain regions that show
  continuous levels of heightened activation and plasticity across the
  lifespan</strong>. Imaging studies of people with genetic predispositions to AD
  are consistent with these findings, suggesting a mechanism whereby
  neural efficiency or cognitive reserve may diminish Aβ deposition. The
  aggregated findings unify observations from cellular and molecular
  studies with human cognitive neuroscience to reveal potential
  mechanisms of AD development.</p>

"Depolarization and hyperpolarization in stereocilia of the inner ear <p>It’s a well mentioned fact that when the stereocilia of the cochlear hair cells bend in one direction, the hair cell depolarizes, and when the stereocilia bend in the other direction, the cell hyperpolarizes. When the basilar membrane vibrates, the stereocilia are bent back and forth, creating depolarizations in the hair cells followed by hyperpolarizations. What I’m having trouble understanding is why this is significant. This does not determine the frequency of the sound wave, as that is determined by the location along the basilar membrane that the wave impinges on. I don’t see how this would determine amplitude either, seeing as a greater amplitude would only create more drastic bending of a greater number of hair cells. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>

"Why do physicians try to match HLA complexes for organ transplant? <p>My understanding of acute transplant rejection is that donor dendritic cells present donor antigens on MHC1 to host naive CD8+ T-cells resulting in an immune response against the graft.

<p>Reasoning: I imagine in the case where MHC1 complexes between donor and host are different that the  t-cell receptor is unable to bind the MHC1 complex in the first place..making the transplant essentially invisible. In the case where MHC1 complex between donor and host are the same, the t-cell receptor would bind the MHC1 complex, and increase the likelihood of an immune response.

"Trouble understanding how uncouplers in the thylakoid membrane increase the rates of the Electron transport chain? <p>I am a undergrad in a cell physiology class and just did a learning exercise involving testing rates of the electron transport chain via the reduction of DCPIP, analyzed by spectrophotometry. ( I think...  D:   )    </p>

<p>So from what I understand, uncouplers stop the ""connection"" of the ETC and ATP synthase indirectly. And in our lab period we used a hydrogen ionophore(ammonia) as our uncoupler( I think... D:  ).  </p>

<p>So for our results I obtained this graph**(The Y axis should be absorbance(600nm)) sorry**...: </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lsrO3.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lsrO3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Where tube 1 through 3 was a collection of thykloid membranes isolated from spinach leaves; tube 1 being kept in foil until the 10th min mark to then measure absorbance as a control. Where tube 2 and 3 were exposed to light for the 10mins, with absorbance readings being taking every 1 min. And with tube 3 having the added ammonia(from what I understand, the uncoupler). </p>

<p>Therefore how does the ammonia uncoupler speed up the electron transport chain? </p>

<p>My thoughts after googling are that since PQ( plastoquinone) is partially responsible for establishing the proton gradient for the thylakoid mebrane, since it transports H+ ions from the stroma to the lumen upon reduction, that if there was this ammonia uncoupler, that could travel through the membrane due to its lack of charge, it could then bind with the H+ ions forming $\ce{NH4+}$ in the lumen. </p>

<p>So then if the lumen now has less H+ ions then the high(lumen) to low(stroma) H+ gradient would be ruined/weakened. </p>

<p><strong>So this is the part I guess confused with; if there is less of a H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane, then how does that have any bearing on the reduction of the added DCPIP or the speed at which its reduced?</strong> </p>

<p>Since tube 3 went the fastest to clear( ~0 absorbance), this is only when it is reduced yes? This means then that in tube 3, the reduction of DCPIP  happened the fastest. </p>

<p>So then does this mean that DCPIP, the artificial electron acceptor, takes over for PQ somehow? Why does PQ have trouble ""doing its job"" in the presence of the weakened H+ gradient?</p>

"Why cancer mutations do accumulate sequentially? <p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudson_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">Knudson hypothesis</a>, cancer mutations accumulate in order. Statistics says, that cancer probability increases as sixth order of age, which may mean six consequential steps to cancer.</p>

<p>But, mutations are random in nature. There is no apparent cause, why mutations ABCDEF can't occur in reverse order, i.e. FEDCBA and any other possible orders.</p>

<p>If unordered, any number of required mutations should cause flat age dependency.</p>

<p>Hence, something is ordering these mutations, i.e. making mutation B impossible until A occurs and so on.</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Cancer incidence dependency on age:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FeZRC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The graph is not linear, which means that mutations are not independent.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Let's regard some cancer, which requires 6 mutations. It's incidence distribution should be like shown above.</p>

<p>Now suppose we knew the distribution of all precancer stages, i.e. the distribution of people with 1, 2, 3 and so on mutations. These distributions should look similar to final distribution</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KxJKP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now let's regard only one (first) mutation.</p>

<p>Why is it's incidence age dependent?</p>

<p>Mutations are random. They should not depend on age. If they do depend on age, then they are not random. If ""they"" are not random, then ""they"" are not mutations. </p>

<p>Or, in other words, the cause of progression is not a mutation itself.</p>

"At what point during an action potential are the sodium potassium pumps working? <p>I'm trying to understand how all of the potentials during an action potential are created. My question specifically is about the sodium potassium pumps, however I would also be grateful if someone could verify if I have grasped the concepts correctly.</p>

<p>From what I understand, the resting membrane potential is at around $-60\rm\,mV$, close to the equilibrium potential for potassium (from the Nernst equation) because the permeability of potassium is much greater than that of sodium, even though the permeability is low. </p>

<p>However, the resting potential is not as negative as the equilibrium potential for potassium because of some permeability of sodium and the permeability of potassium is very low so the tiny permeability of sodium has some impact in preventing the potential reaching the equilibrium potential of potassium. </p>

<p>When the threshold potential of $-50\rm\,mV$ is reached, the voltage gated $\ce{Na+}$ ion channels open, and sodium ions enter the cell, causing depolarisation. The potential rises to about $+40\rm\,mV$, which is close to the equilibrium potential for sodium (because the permeability for sodium is much greater than for potassium). However, it doesn't quite reach the equilibrium potential for sodium because of some potassium ions leaving the cell. </p>

<p>When the $+40\rm\,mV$ threshold is reached, sodium channels close and potassium channels open. Because of the now much higher permeability of potassium ions compared with when the membrane is at its resting potential, the potential becomes much closer to the equilibrium potential for potassium, which I think is about $-90\rm\,mV$, and therefore the cell hyperpolarises. Then the potassium channels close.</p>

<p>Now I'm unsure as to how the resting membrane potential is reached from the hyper polarised state, and I also do not see where the action of the sodium potassium pumps comes into this.</p>

"Does homeopathic or herbal treatment of cancer have any scientific recognition? <p>Even though we have a very high tech society, cancer is still a serious issue. We humans still are not entirely capable of fighting cancer. </p>

"What are the secondary structure requirements for cell-penetrating peptides AKA protein transduction domains <h1>Cell penetrating peptides.</h1>

<p>Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a class of short amino acid sequences which are sufficient for crossing cell membranes and delivering themselves along with any attached cargo into the cytoplasm of cells. They were branded CPPs recently, while the term ""protein transduction domain"" (PTD) was used in the early days of their study, when the necessary sequences were being isolated from native proteins with cell-penetrating activity (notably, HIV-1 Tat).</p>

<p>Most of the scientific literature I have found on CPPs focuses on their potential relevance for targeted drug delivery, and mostly discusses the delivery of proteins and nanoparticles via fusion of CPPs to the N-terminus of the target protein. The only <a href=""http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5721/position-of-cell-penetrating-peptide"">Stack Exchange question &amp; answer on CPPs</a> also points to a discussion of N-terminal fusion of CPPs to a cargo peptide. However, research on cell penetrating peptides has come a long way since <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576229/"" rel=""nofollow"">the 2005 article</a> referenced in that post.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22465171"" rel=""nofollow"">The 2012 Milletti review</a> highlights that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of different classes of cell penetrating peptides, including hydrophobic CPPs, primary amphipathic CPPs, alpha-helical amphipathic CPPs, beta sheet amphipathic CPPs, and proline-rich CPPs, among others. And that is just between 2005 and 2012! The Milletti 2012 article also covers some CPPs isolated from other viruses.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find a review of similar detail written since, although I'm sure much progress has been made in the field. </p>

<p><em>Although it is not my main question, I would appreciate any citations for more recent reviews which go into detail on the molecular mechanism of cell penetration for one or more classes of CPPs - especially a review of the function of PTDs in their native proteins.</em></p>

<p>I have only begun to research CPPs and PTDs in their native proteins and in the drug-delivery setting because it became apparent that a protein I am studying for an undergraduate thesis may have an internal PTD which is essential for its function. I am no expert on the topic and I would appreciate information on CPPs/PTDs including further synonyms for CPPs/PTDs to aid in my literature search - especially synonyms specific to native proteins with CPP-like functions.</p>

<h1>What are the secondary structure requirements for cell-penetrating peptides?</h1>

<p><strong>My question is whether the previously described positively charged CPPs and/or the new classes of CPPs described in Milletti 2012 are only functional as N-terminal fusions, or whether they typically function efficiently when they are incorporated within an internal loop</strong> (in terms of primary sequence, but still exposed to the solvent). The 2005 article cited in the previous Stack Exchange question on this topic stated that the CPP derived from HIV-1 Tat is based on residues 47-57, which are internal residues of the 86 amino acid protein - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9188504"" rel=""nofollow"">a protein which has cell-penetrating activity in its native role in HIV-1 infection</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, my question is not whether or not this ever occurs - <em>it clearly does</em> - but to what extent do CPPs isolated from internal sequences of native proteins have CPP-like functions in their native proteins?</p>

<p>The system I am studying for my thesis is a virus, so any information specifically on CPPs and PTDs function in the native proteins of viruses would be particularly useful. </p>

"What is the essence of difference of how different chemicals affect the same receptor? <p>It is known that various chemicals can bind to the same receptor type, producing different effects. Be these chemicals agonists or antagonists, there are more variations in how they influence the receptor than just sending an activation or inhibition signal. There seem to be various flavours of activation (not sure about inhibition), where, for example, a psychedelic drug binding to a serotonin receptor produces a different result than serotonin itself.</p>

<p>For a more clear representation, I have split the question into logical parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the essense of this difference? Does it come from the chemicals molecule properties like shape and electron configurations of the atoms?</p></li>
<li><p>If we were to draw two comparative pictures of how two such different chemicals affect a receptor, how would we picture that? What would we chose to be the characteristic figure(s) on our pictures? What qualities of the connection (probably changing over time) would we consider to display on the picture?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Does this question make sense or are there any false assumptions?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Response to the comment by WYSIWYG: I cannot cite any source saying so. It is that I got this question at some point: is ligand-receptor activation a binary function, which can only give either 0 (no interaction or inhibition) or 1 (activation) values, or it is something more varied?</p>

<p>Taking into account that ligand-receptor interaction is molecule-molecule, it is logical to assume that the resulting complex can put the receptor molecule in a variety of states, depending on the ligand molecule structure. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_action"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> the <code>Ionic Bonds</code> and <code>Hydrogen Bonds</code> sections shed some light on this - the described interaction patterns seem like they can produce quite different results. Like, for example, they put receptors molecules electron cloud configurations in different states. But does in reality such interaction always result in either 0 or 1 state of the receptor?</p>

<p>The pdf paper refered from <a href=""http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6954/how-does-serotonergic-5-ht2a-mediated-psychedelia-work"">this question</a> leaves the reader to guess: are the varying effects of the chemicals produced solely by their profile of different affinity to different groups of receptors, or do they also interact with each receptor type differently. In other words, is the drug effect produced by a certain amount of 1s being fired by the receptors, or is it changing the quality of their firing signal itself, i.e. making the receptor to initiate different, non-typical processes inside the cells?</p>

<p>Or, in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_action"" rel=""nofollow"">cited Wikipedia article</a>, under section <code>The specificity of drugs</code> it is said that muscarine and nicotine can selectively activate specific subtypes of acetylcholine receptors. Is the result of these chemicals activating these receptors exactly the same as of acetylcholine? If we deliver both muscarine and nicotine to their sites, will they produce the same effect as if we deliver acetylcholine to both of them?</p>

<p>Also, I cannot really find much information on what lies beyond the receptor, namely - how does it send the signal somewhere else.. but I guess that's molecule-molecule again, so here we get the chance of varying result too. Or don't we?</p>

<p>I know I have made solutions of plasmid maxipreps of at least 1µg/µl, and the <a href=""http://www.nanodrop.com/Productnd2000specs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Nanodrop DNA quantifier datasheet</a> has a maximum DNA detectable limit of 15µg/µl, but can anyone find a source for the maximum solubility level of generic DNA? For example, the solubility of a specific plasmid of approx. 5kb in length would be a good ballpark answer for this question. </p>

"what are hyperbranched amplicons in DNA sequencing? <p>I am reading an article about single-cell sequencing:

"Transitivity of Species Definitions <p>There are many <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#Definitions_of_species"">definitions of ""species""</a> which usually take the form</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals are of the same species if ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An implied (rarely made explicit) property of any sensible species definition is that the relation <strong>""is the same species as""</strong> should be an <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation"">equivalence relation</a></strong> (the reason why this is sensible is that only such a relation partitions the set of all individuals into <em>equivalence classes</em>, that is, separate species). In particular, it should be <strong>transitive</strong>, that is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If A and B are of the same species, and B and C are of the same
  species, then it follows that A and C are also of the same species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<h3>It appears to me that all species definitions in use violate that property.</h3>

<p><br></p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>Are the <strong>Chihuahua</strong> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rRIrN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> and the <strong>Great Dane</strong> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3R0zY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> of the same species?</p>

<p>Not according to the ""biological"" species definition, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals are of the same species if and only if they can <strong>produce fertile offspring.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since that is (presumably) not true of Chihuahua and Great Dane, according to that definition, the two dog breeds are not of the same species.</p>

<h2>However...</h2>

<p>Let us say that the Chihuahua can produce fertile offspring with the <strong>Dachshund</strong>...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lHzsW.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>... and the Dachshund with the <strong>Golden Retriever</strong>...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TpUqC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>... and that at last with the <strong>Great Dane</strong> as desired.</p>

<p>Then, if we assume transitivity, Chihuahua and Great Dane <em>are</em> of the same species <strong>- contradiction!</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<h1>Another Example</h1>

<p>Are the <strong>Chimpanzee</strong> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KnHwQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> and the <strong>White Oak</strong> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RDoOH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> of the same species?</p>

<p>Intuitively, they are of course not, the very idea seems ridiculous. Sure enough, with the definition (a variation of the ""genetic"" species definition)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals are of the same species if and only if <strong>their genome differs in less than 0.5% of base pairs.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>the two are indeed <em>not</em> of the same species.</p>

<p><strong>However, we can again construct a ""chain"" of intermediate individuals, each of which is similar enough to its predecessor to satisfy the definition, eventually connecting Ape and Tree and violating transitivity again.</strong></p>

<p><br></p>

<h1>My question to biologists: How is this problem resolved in practice? Are there any species definitions that preserve transitivity?</h1>

"Proof of the equivalence between two ways of defining ESS <h2>Background</h2>

<p>Two common ways of defining what an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) are:</p>

<p><strong>First definition</strong>:
Consider a population composed of populations playing two strategies, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$.
Let us denote $W(\mathbf{p})$ the average fitness of the
strategy $\mathbf{p}$. A population consisting of individuals playing $\mathbf{p}$ will be an ESS if, whenever a small amount of deviant individuals playing $\mathbf{q}$, the old type $\mathbf{p}$ fares batter than the newcomers $\mathbf{q}$. This means that for all
$\mathbf{p}\neq \mathbf{q}$,
\begin{equation}
  W(\mathbf{p}) &gt; W (\mathbf{q})
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>Second definition</strong>: $E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ is the payoff for $\mathbf{p}$-strategist against a $\mathbf{q}$-strategist. The strategy $\mathbf{p}$ is an ESS if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>$E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p})\geq E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) \quad \forall
  \mathbf{q}$</p></li>
<li><p>If $\mathbf{q}\neq \mathbf{p}$ and $E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p}) = E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})$, then
$E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})&gt; E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{q})$</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Question (shorter version)</h2>

<p>The above two ways of defining what an ESS should be equivalent. How can I prove such an equivalence? Alternatively, do you know of a book (or a paper) that has this proof? </p>

<h2>Question (longer version)</h2>

<p>I understand that the first definition implies the second. According to the first definition:
\begin{align*}
   W(\mathbf{p}) - W (\mathbf{q}) &amp;&gt;0\\
   (1-\epsilon) [E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p}) - E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})]
   + \epsilon [E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) - E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{q})] &amp;&gt;0
 \end{align*}
where $\epsilon$ is frequency of individuals playing $\mathbf{q}$. Since $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, if the above inequality is true, the conditions 1 and 2 in the second definition must be true. The part that I find less clear is how the second definition implies the first definition. More specifically, that if $\mathbf{p}$ is a strict Nash equilibrium (i.e., $E(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{p})&gt; E(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})$), then $W(\mathbf{p}) &gt; W (\mathbf{q})$.</p>

"Does A/T, G/C pairing exist in haploid? <p>I'm trying to understanding base pairing. So every linear chromosome is a double stranded double helix.

<p>EDIT: Part of my confusion comes from the fact that in diploid organisms, each parent gives 1 chromosome to the child. If the double stranded property is the same as saying an organism is diploid, does this mean that say if a nucleotide on one chromosome is A, then the nucleotide on the other chromosome in the same loci must be T?

"Why aren't mitochondria and plastids considered symbiotes of eukaryotic cells? <p>Mitochondria and plastids have their own DNA, their own membranes, and their reproduction is not tied to the reproductive cycle of the host cell. However, they are considered to be organelles rather than a separate species in symbiosis with eukaryotes. Granted, mitochondria and plastids are incapable of living outside their parent cells, and likewise eukaryotes are incapable of surviving without the help of mitochondria and plastids. But this is also true of many other symbiotic pairs in Eukarya. So where does the distinction lie? What makes mitochondria and plastids organelles rather than separate organisms? </p>

"Common Ancestry of ETCs and ATP Synthase complexes <p>Rickettsiales are widely regarded as the ancestor of eukaryotic mitochondria through endosymbiosis.
Cyanobacteria are widely regarded as the ancestor of eukaryotic chloroplasts through endosymbiosis. </p>

<p>These two organelles bear striking similarities in terms of structure and mechanics.

"Is the sense for salt depending on the electrolyte level in our body? <p>I often noticed, after (heavy) physical activity like cycling, running, swimming or working an isotonic drink (to recover the electrolyte level) tastes less ""salty"" compared to when drinking it before the activity.</p>

<p>Is this possible or am I just hallucinating?</p>

<p>The object of this (if it's real) could be: </p>

<ul>
<li>to save us of taking too much salt</li>
<li>to reduce the reluctance against salt if our body is undersupplied (with sodium ions)</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is, that the electrolyte or particularly the sodium (chloride) level in our body influences the cells/nerves that sense the taste for salt on our tongue.</p>

<ol>
<li>If there is enough salt in our body, the cells are saturated with e.g. sodium ions (higher polarization since there are more ions)</li>
<li><code>NaCl</code> and other salts (probably <code>KCl</code> too) will then dissociate into <code>Na+</code> and <code>Cl-</code> (etc.)</li>
<li>The <code>Cl-</code> will then attract more <code>Na+</code> from the cells causing deplolarization</li>
<li>Our brain converts these signals into the proper perception</li>

"Epilepsy explained by computational neuroscience <p>A few years ago, on my maths masters, I did a module in theoretical neuroscience. I was shown that the mathematical framework the course developed for neurons, with a small adjustment in the parameters, would produce spike trains similar to those observed during epileptic kindling. These parametric tweaks could be attributed to mutations in ion channel/receptor structures. This was one of the highlights of the course, and when I came to apply for a math/bio interdisciplinary doctoral program, I cited it as such in my personal statement.</p>

"Compressing structural information in PDB files <p>There seems to be a lot of redundancy in PDB files.

<p>These two residues occupy 1,638 bytes as plain text; when compressed with gzip, they occupy 467 bytes.  For reference, the format of ATOM records in PDB files is defined at wwpdb.org/documentation/format33/sect9.html#ATOM.</p>

<p>Almost all of the data in the above excerpt seems redundant.  The first field (ATOM), second field (atom index, e.g. 332 in the first row), sixth field (residue index, e.g. 42), tenth field (occupancy, e.g. 1.00) and last field (element name, e.g. N) seem clearly extraneous.  The fourth field (residue name) could be shortened from three characters to 1 character, or simply an integer.  I'm not a data compression expert, but I imagine gzip picks up most of this redundancy.</p>

<p>Slightly less obviously, the atom names for each residue also seem unnecessary.  To my understanding, the atomic composition of all residues' backbones will always be the same, and represented in PDB files as ""N"", ""CA"", ""C"", ""O"".  The same for the atomic composition of the residues' respective sidechains: a lysine sidechain will always be ""CB"", ""CG"", ""CD"", ""CE"", ""NZ"" and a phenylalanine sidechain will always be ""CB"", ""CG"", ""CD1"", ""CD2"", ""CE1"", ""CE2"", ""CZ"".  </p>

<p>A subtler redundancy, but one that might increase compressibility a lot, seems like it could be in the atomic coordinates themselves.  For example, in the backbone, would it be possible to deduce each residue atom's X, Y and Z coordinates (12 data points: 4 atoms * 3 coordinates) given only their phi, psi and omega <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dihedral_angle&amp;oldid=474965018#Dihedral_angles_of_biological_molecules"" rel=""nofollow"">dihedral angles</a> (3 data points)?  Could applying dihedral angles to atoms within sidechains similarly remove the need to explicitly list the 3D coordinates there?</p>

<p>Could ""temperature  factor"" (the second to last field in the excerpt) be losslessly removed, or compressed in some non-obvious way?  What are some other possible optimizations that could be used to more efficiently compress PDB files?  Are there any obvious grave performance implications of these various compression techniques on the speed of a hypothetical decompressor to convert back to the official PDB format?  Have these questions been answered in the literature or an existing PDB-specific compression program?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers or feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Given that no PDB-specific file compressors seem to be available, I suppose my specific goal is to develop one.  One potential application I see for this is in significantly decreasing fresh times-to-render in certain use cases of browser-based molecular visualization programs, e.g. <a href=""http://jmol.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jmol</a>, <a href=""http://web.chemdoodle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ChemDoodle Web Components</a> or <a href=""http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp/glmol/viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLmol</a>.  Another application could be decreasing the time and size of data needed to download archives of PDB files like those described <a href=""http://www.wwpdb.org/downloads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>This would of course require a way to efficiently decompress the packed PDB files, but this trade-off between decompression time and download time seems like it could be useful in at least some niche applications.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>:</p>

<p>In a comment, nico asks ""How would compressing the file decrease render time?"".  Decreasing gzipped PDB file size (e.g. by half or more) and thus decreasing time needed to download the file would decrease the time between when the PDB file was requested from a remote server and when the structure was rendered by a molecular visualization program running on a client machine. Apologies if that use of ""fresh time-to-render"" in that context was unclear.</p>

<p>A lossless compression could also involve encoding the PDB file to an object (e.g. JSON) that is faster to parse for the visualization program, and decrease render times that way.  Looking around further, if the application only required displaying the 3D structure and not also retaining data about specific atoms and residues, then using a binary mesh compression (e.g. <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/webgl-loader/"" rel=""nofollow"">webgl-loader</a>) seems like it would probably decrease time-to-render even more.</p>

Some of my advisors have recommended me Netlogo because his simplicity and good interface, but i don´t know if it is enough powerful to run simulations of many interactions between a lot of agents. I hear that MASON is also good but you need a little background in java programming.

"Why is Fast Fourier Transform applied to raw EEG data? <p>I am trying to understand <em>why</em> Fast Fourier Transform (<strong>FFT</strong>) is used in the analysis of raw EEG channel data.</p>

<p>My understanding (at the 30,000 ft view) is that FFT decomposes linear differential equations with non-sinusoidal source terms (which are fairly difficult to solve) and breaks them down into component equations (<em>with</em> sinusoidal source terms) that are easy to solve. It then combines each of these component/partial solutions to solve the original equation. In laymen's terms, it's like taking a smoothie, and breaking it down into its recipe of ingredients. Doing so would allow us to study and analyze each ingredient as it relates to the final product (the smoothie).</p>

<p><strong>But how does this relate to raw (non-FFT-decomposed) EEG data?</strong> My understanding of a single channel of EEG data is that it is essentially a measurement of voltage over time.  What is to be gained by using FFT to break this voltage/time signal down into its constituent frequencies (alpha/beta/gamma/delta/mu waves), etc.? What additional information can each frequency tell us about the raw data?</p>

"Why is saltatory conduction faster than continuous conduction? <p>How does spacing apart sodium and potassium channels allow the action potential to travel faster down the axon? This is the reason always cited for saltatory conduction and myelination, but my mental model of conduction tells me that the density of ion gates along the axon should not affect the speed of the AP. </p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a myelinated axon. A wave of Na+ from action potential site 1, a node of Ranvier, rushes into and quickly diffuses down the axon. (It travels in both directions, but backwards is still in the refractory period.) It diffuses through the myelinated region, its concentration always diminishing. Before it attenuates too much, however, it happens upon node of Ranvier 2, where it triggers another action potential. A new wave of Na+ rushes in and the cycle repeats. This should be plain so far.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is actually a node of Ranvier halfway between node 1 and 2, called node 1.5. The wave of Na+, on its way to node 2, happens to trigger an action potential at node 1.5, from which a wave of Na+ pours in and either boosts the original wave or replaces it by taking its momentum. Now the reinforced wave proceeds to node 2 and triggers it just as soon as, perhaps even sooner than, if node 1.5 had not existed. Repeatedly insert nodes at higher densities until the situation is simply lack of myelination, and we conclude that unmyelinated axons can transmit an action-potential-triggering wave of Na+ as fast as or faster than a myelinated one.</p>

<p>In short, my point of confusion is this: <strong>I cannot see how a higher density of gated channels can possibly slow down the wavefront of Na+ that triggers action potentials.</strong> If anything, the additional influxes of Na+ should speed up the all-important wavefront, assuming that new waves really ""either boost the original wave or replace it by taking its momentum"", and also assuming that the wavefront of Na+ is really all-important for signal transmission, and also assuming that the mere presence of (voltage?) gated ion channels in the membrane does not significantly retard the wavefront.</p>

<p>But the usual explanation for why saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction (a fact I hope is empirically and <em>unambiguously</em> established) relies on <strong>the putative slowing effect of ion channels on the signal fore. Please explain this effect in more detail, if it is not a misconception.</strong></p>

"What has caused life to choose this unfathomably tiny subset of all possible proteins? <p>I wonder why life uses the particular proteins that it does, about 10^6 different proteins, I think? Evolution cannot explain it because the number of possible proteins is far far too large to ever come into existence anywhere in the visible universe, let alone on Earth. And evolutionary selection only works on stuff that exists.</p>

<p>Is there some chemical or other explanation, or is this an unresolved paradox in biology?</p>

<p>The median number of amino acids in a human protein is 375. Most are longer than 200 and maybe all are longer than 100. The 20 different kinds of amino acids can be combined to 20^375 = 10^487 different proteins which have the length 375.</p>

<p>If the entire crust of the Earth consisted of proteins which all were 375 long and each protein mutated once every nanosecond during 5 billion years and each mutation resulted in a protein which is unique in time and space, and there exists 100 such ""protein Earths"" around every star and 1000 billion stars in each of 1000 billion galaxies in the visible universe, it still only adds up to something like 10^100 proteins. Adding 10^37 years until the last star remnant has cooled down to less than 1 Kelvin, doesn't change this picture, almost all of the possible proteins will literally never exist anywhere. Even if I'm off by a factor a million on each of those numbers, only one in 10^300 of all possible median length proteins could ever exist.</p>

<p>Since our mind-bendingly small subset of possible proteins supports life, shouldn't we expect that many many (as in 10^300) other potential subsets of different proteins would do so too? And can we conclude that if DNA/protein based life has originated somewhere else, it will not have even one single protein in common with us or with any other independent origin of life? Or is this focus on proteins somehow invalid?</p>

"What is Environmental Robustness? Is it different from plasticity? <p><a href=""http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110224"" rel=""nofollow"">Hansen (2006)</a> in his review uses the concept of <code>environmental robustness</code> independently of the other concepts of robustness (at pages 139 and 140) without defining it.</p>

<p><strong>How is the term <code>environmental robustness</code> usually defined?</strong></p>

<p>The concept of robustness (aka genetic robustness) can be further decoupled into mutational robustness, developmental robustness and maybe some others. I think envirnmental robustness is one of these sub-categories of (genetic) robustness.</p>

<p>Intuitively, I understand environmental robustness as something that is very close to <code>plasticity in the broad sense</code>. What I call <code>plasticity in the broad sense</code> is any phenotypic response to an environment whether or not the response is adaptive or not. Therefore, <code>plasticity in the broad sense</code> is <code>adaptive plasticity</code> + <code>non-adaptive plasticity</code>. I would intuitively think that a genotype is environmentally robust if the phenotype it produces varies little with environment, that is if this genotype has low plasticity (in the broad sense). Am I using a more or less standard definition of <code>environmental robustness</code>?</p>

"Is there a mechanism by which mammals lose interest in a partner after mating? <p>I'm reading the book called ""<a href=""http://www.reuniting.info/download/pdf/Cupid_PR_author.pdf"">Cupid's poison arrow</a>"", which revolves around a rather simple assumption: most mammals, including humans have a genetic program that is responsible for ever increasing dissatisfaction with a mate after intercourse with orgasm.</p>

<p>The book proceeds to give a number of examples, here's what I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect"">Coolidge effect</a>, where libido is revived upon exposure to a novel, receptive partner.</li>
<li>Male rate copulating on average 8 times with a receptive female before losing interest</li>

</ul>

<p>The book contains a <strong>large amount of anecdotal evidence</strong> of humans experiencing negative outlook on their partner after orgasmic intercourse, with more intense intercourse producing more intense dissatisfaction. </p>

<p>The author proceeds to formulate a hypothesis that humans and other mammals have a genetic program that fosters sepratation between mates and seeking of a novel mate as a mechanism to promote more genetic diversity in offspring (as opposed to monogamy)</p>

"Amino acid profile of GPCRs <blockquote>
  <p>You are studying cellular signalling through a newly identified GPCR.
   Specifically you’re working on a pair of newly identified GPCRs, 
  GPCR-A and GPCR-B. Each binds the same small ligand, but activates different 
  heterotrimeric G-proteins that act on adenylyl cyclase.<br>
  Your grad student mentor explains that both the receptors and the 
  Gα and Gβγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins are membrane associated.  You examine the sequences of the seven predicted 
  transmembrane α-helices of GPCR-B. You’re surprised to find that there are 
  hydrophilic amino acid residues in these helices. How can you explain this 
  observation?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was an MIT quiz question.I have my guesses. But I wanted to know the correct answer.</p>

<p>Well, since GPCRs are transmembrane proteins, normally the transmembrane helices have higher hydrophobic amino acids or only hydrophobic, non-polar aa . Here it says they saw some polar residues. Well my guess is that, since there are two GPCRs a and b that bind to the same ligand, it could be that one activates a stimulatory G protein and the other an inhibitory G protein Gi . So probably the polar amino acids which are in the transmembrane alpha helical segment of the stimulatory GPCR is slightly displaced and is in the intracellular region of the inhibitory GPCR (Gpcr that activates inhibitory G protein ). To be in the intracellular region, it has to be hydrophilic.
This is all I can think of. </p>

<p>Any help with this question is much appreciated. It is not a homework question for me. I don't go to MIT. I just wanted to reinforce my concepts.</p>

"Should we induce fever to assist healing? <p>I am currently reading ""The Fundamentals of Anatomy Physiology"" 10th edition, and have found it an incredibly interesting book. I have just been reading about the lymphatic system, and the various Leukocytes and their roles. When it mentioned fever as an immune response, I was familiar with the concept: Bacteria and viruses operate very nicely at our usual body temperature, but not so well at around 39 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>What I wasn't aware of was ""For each 1 degree Celsius rise in body temperature, metabolic rate increases by 10 percent. Cells can move faster, and enzymatic reactions take place quicker."" (Quoted from page 828 of that book).</p>

<p>Now that seems like a massive benefit (though I believe you could only really push 1 or 2 degrees before you start getting into dangerous territory), but I notice that fever is not present in all illnesses. Inflammation seems to induce fever through the wounded area, which makes sense.</p>

<p>So now for my question: Could it be beneficial to artificially induce fever in a person who has an illness if they are not already experiencing fever? I believe a few things would need to be considered (more than likely a lot more than I can think to list):</p>

<li>Increased metabolic activity would surely need a higher energy intake would it not?</li>
<li>Are there cells that are actually going to suffer from the temperature increase?</li>
<li>I'm assuming this would actually be a rather poor technique to deal with cancer as from my currently limited knowledge, it is simply a cell that is producing abnormal proteins. If this is the case, the metabolic increase would likely apply to these abnormal cells, resulting in faster proliferation. Are there other such cells/infections that will benefit from temperature increase?</li>

<p>Finally, what are possible downsides of long term fever if energy intake is sufficient to maintain an increased metabolic rate at these higher temperatures?</p>

"How does good pasta dough feel to the touch? <p>I have just been given an Imperia Pasta Roller as a present and have wasted no time in trying to make pasta. As advised in the instruction manual, I have made a small batch of pasta just using water and passed this through the rollers in order to clean any factory impurities or debris from the machine. I noticed that the pasta (eggless I hasten to add) was quite soft, much softer than shop bought fresh pasta. I worked some more flour into the dough and the pasta held up quite well to being passed through the rollers. This was then thrown in the bin.  </p>

<p>The next batch that I made, following a recipe by Jamie Oliver, called for 100 grams of flour to 1 egg. I am using Tipo 00 flour. The resulting dough felt firmer and very slightly sticky to the touch but when cooked was very soggy and flabby in texture, not very appetising at all.</p>

<p>For my next batch I added a little extra flour and kneaded it for longer. The dough was dryer than the previous batch and when I took a few strips and put them in boiling water, they cooked perfectly. However the remainder, when I went back to it a couple of hours later had stuck to itself and turned into a solid mass that was really difficult to separate. I had dusted it with fine cornmeal to stop this happening. I was advised not to coat it in flour.</p>

<p>Can anyone please give me some advice on how the dough should feel when correctly prepared (how stiff, how moist or how sticky it should feel) and also some advice on how to stop it from forming a solid mass before I have time to cook it.</p>

"How to bind chopped pepperoni, salami, and bacon <p>I have this sandwich I make that I think is pretty good, except that I have a problem with it falling apart. </p>

<p>Basically I take sliced salami, sliced pepperoni, (precooked) bacon, and banana peppers and throw them into a food processor to grind it up fairly ground up but not pasty. </p>

<p>I then put it in a skillet with some olive oil and brown/crisp it a little and then I add some red wine vinegar and black pepper to taste and set aside. </p>

<p>Then I take a loaf of french bread (there's this ""everything"" french bread at my local store that has ""everything"" seasoning on top of it, which I like to use, vs. plain french bread). I cut it in half lengthwise and scoop out some of the inside of the bread.  </p>

<p>I squirt some horseradish sauce on the bottom side, then add a layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese. Then I add heap of the meat mix, and finally top with another layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese.  </p>

<p>I then butter the skillet and press the sandwich on the skillet on each side for about a minute (like a cubano). </p>

<p>So this is one of my favorite sandwiches to make, and I think it's yummy! The problem is it's a little bit of a pain to eat, because there really isn't anything binding the meat together.</p>

<p>So I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make it not fall apart.  The first thing I tried is to shred/grate the cheese and mix it in with the meat. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. I assume it's because of the olive oil and vinegar, but I haven't tried outright removing them, as it's a crucial part of the flavor I'm going for.  </p>

<p>Next time I get a chance to make this sandwich, I was thinking maybe I would try browning the meat without adding the oil/vinegar, and instead sprinkle them on the top while building the sandwich. I figure this <em>might</em> help, but I'm not entirely sure it will completely help, since these meats are a bit fatty in their own right. </p>

<p>I was also thinking I could go the route of making it a patty (like making a hamburger patty), where I mix an egg and some breadcrumbs and cook it as a patty. I'm not so sure I really want to do that though. I'm not outright opposed to it, but I already feel like the flavor is where I want it, so I'd like to avoid throwing new flavors into the mix (though admittedly, eggs and breadcrumbs are fairly neutral).  </p>

<p>But I'm also not sure I dig the idea of a patty for this sandwich in general. I like the mouth feels of heaping mass of chopped meat, and I actually don't mind if there's <em>some</em> amount of ""fall apartness"". I just really want to reduce it a bit somehow.  </p>

<p>I'm certainly down for experimenting but I'm not by any means even fractionally rich, so I can only indulge in this pleasure about once a month or so, so I was hoping I could maybe see if anybody else out there might have any ideas?</p>

"Gluten Free Thin Crust Pizza - Tips and Explanation? <p>we have a gluten-free pizza crust recipe that works out pretty well. Since I'm relatively new to GF (we recently found out that my wife has Celiac), I'm curious as to how the recipe works and what difference some of the changes we've made have on the outcome. I'm also looking for any pointers to help make the crust a little less ""scratch the roof of your mouth like Captain Crunch."" Overall, it comes out nice and crispy, but perhaps just a little too much. </p>

<p>The recipe:</p>

<pre><code>Ingredients
-----------

&gt; Yeast mixture
1 1/3 cup warm milk
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons rapid rise yeast
    - we've taken to using 1 tablespoon of pizza dough yeast instead

&gt; Dry Mix
1 cup tapioca flour
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin powder
2 teaspoons dried italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons xantham gum
1 1/3 cups brown rice flour

Directions
----------
First, I mix the yeast mixture. Pizza dough yeast seems to work better and give a
slightly better crust than plain rapid rise. 

? I've always had trouble getting the yeast to really dissolve completely, there's
usually chunks left in the milk unless I whisk for a good 15 minutes. Can I use a
kitchen mixer to achieve a better dissolve?

In a separate bowl, I combine the dry ingredients. Then, I mix the yeasty milk into
the dry ingredients and finally mix in 2 teaspoons olive oil and 2 teaspoons apple cider
vinegar. 

? We accidentally mixed in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and apple cider vinegar once,
but didn't really notice a difference. What exactly are they helping with in the recipe
and why didn't such a gross overmeasurement make a difference?

Next, I butter and flour a baking sheet and then plop the dough down. I flour my
hands and the dough and spread it until it's nice and thin across the sheet. I rub olive
oil into the patted down dough and then cook untopped for 10 minutes in a 450 degree
oven. Remove and add toppings and return to the oven for 20 minutes.
</code></pre>

<p>Any tips and maybe some general explanation of what's going on here would be appreciated - so far this has been the quickest and best thin crust GF recipe we've done.</p>

"Soon-to-be cultured milk with fresh fruit safe for consumption? <p>Recently my cousin started to make yogurt. She told me that she puts diced, fresh fruit (strawberries, peaches) into the inoculated milk (pasteurized or sterilized, I don't know. <sup>1</sup>) and then let this set in the oven at ~50°C for some hours.

<p>At the first thought I couldn't imagine that fresh fruits stay safe for ten days (I wouldn't eat cut fruits that stayed for ten days in the fridge!).

<p>I don't need to mix it in, a topping is fine. I want it <em>salty</em>; I'm thinking of how much I love a good salted caramel. I don't want it to melt salty in the ice cream or on the tongue.

<p>My plan at this point is to make dry caramel as per the instructions of <a href=""http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the/"">David Lebovitz</a> (thanks Allison), mixing Maldon salt in at <em>just</em> the last possible second, much like making a praline, but with salt instead of nuts.</p>

<p>Since we're just speaking of salt and sugar, normally I would just jump into experimentation on something like this, but I'm down to my last few ounces of mail-order Maldon. I want some assurance that I'm on the right track before I risk the last of an ingredient particularly precious to me. It may be months before I see it again.</p>

I'm cooking the dough, then adding the tomato sauce, then adding the cheese and the water doesn't appear until the cheese-phase.

"Pumpkin rotting, need to process it now - any ideas with a long shelf life? <p>I bought 7 huge pumpkins from a gardener two weeks ago. The idea was to store them in the basement, and eat them as soup during the winter.</p>

<p>However, sadly, they have started to rot. (I asked a related gardening question <a href=""http://gardening.stackexchange.com/questions/3133/why-do-my-pumpkins-develop-rotting-black-dots-after-harvesting"">here</a>, it seems to be a fungus from the field.) I need to cut them up, remove the rotting parts, and do something with the good parts right now, otherwise they will be lost. I know no pumpkin-lovers to give them away to, so I would like to continue to store them somehow.    </p>

<p>I have the possibility of putting them into cold storage at about 7°C (ca. 44°F). However, I fear that even there, they will go stale relatively quickly if I just cut them into pieces and do nothing further. I have very little space in the freezer, not nearly enough to take them all.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do with the good pieces that lasts a long time either in cold storage, or (ideally) at room temperature? I'm open to everything, any kind of processing into whatever. </p>

<p>One thing I thought about was pesto - I've seen some very oily pumpkin pesto recipes that actually work with the pulp itself, not only the seeds like most recipes. I'm not sure about the resulting product's shelf life, though. Would the oil make it last longer?</p>

<p>Suggestions would be very welcome, as it would be a shame to let these beautiful vegetables go to waste.</p>

<pre><code>- 4 or 5 coconuts (Google says 1 coconut is 1 or 2 cups of coconut milk)    
- 1/2 pound of ginger (?)
- 1 box of raisins (my guess is 2 cups since I'll be making 4 cups of rice)
- 1 pound of rice (Google says 2 cups uncooked)
- Cinnamon to taste (?)
- Clove to taste (?)
- Salt to taste
- Light brown sugar (?)
- White sugar (?)
</code></pre>

<p>Please help me with ""to taste"" directions. I can't cook, I need specifics. 
1/2 pound of ground ginger? How many thumbs would you use?
Cinnamon and clove to taste? How many ml? 
And what's your guess on the amounts of sugar? </p>

<p>These directions sound so easy but I can't guess on these amounts myself. Appreciate any help, thanks.</p>

"Tasty vs Mild vs Mature Cheddar Cheese <p>I expect Cheddar to come in <strong>Semi-matured</strong>, <strong>Matured</strong> and <strong>Vintage</strong>.
Each indicating increasing amount of time maturing, and increased sharpness.</p>

<p>The term <strong>Mild</strong> also makes sense.</p>

<p>However, alot of cheese, in Australia at least, come in what is called <strong>Tasty</strong>.
On one brand (shown below), both <strong>Tasty</strong> and <strong>Mild</strong> claim to be ""<em>Full Flavoured</em>"".
What is the difference between them?</p>

<p>Other brands sell both <strong>Matured</strong> and <strong>Tasty</strong> and market both as a mature cheese
To me, they all taste, much the same as the <strong>Matured</strong>.</p>

<p>Further, there is also <strong>Extra Tasty</strong> in some brands. <br>
One brand I found says its <strong>Extra Tasty</strong> is matured for 18 months and its <strong>Vintage</strong> is matured for 24 months.</p>

<p>Is it just that Tasty is used instead of Matured, for Marketing Reasons?<br>
Is it that there are special requirements to be able to label your cheese <strong>Matured</strong>,
so cheeses that have failed to meet the technical requirements, 
but taste much the same hare labelled <strong>Tasty</strong> instead?</p>

"How do you serve a hot steak after letting it sit? <p>Everything I have read or watched about grilling a steak says that you should let it sit anywhere between 15 - 30 minutes after cooking it before serving. That's all good and well, but whenever someone makes a steak like that, I get it cold. It might be juicy, but its not hot (barely even warm, really). I actually like it better when I eat a steak fresh off the grill when its still hot.</p>

<p>Is there a way to cook a steak and let it sit, but serve it hot? A lot of people stick steaks in the oven after grilling, but then its still cooking under heat, which isn't really like letting it sit. Are steaks not supposed to be served hot? </p>

It's now a week past it's 'use by' date, and when trying a tiny piece earlier to see if it tasted ok, it had a slight sour taste to it, and I dared no go any further.

"How to get threads in a yeast dough? <p>I think I may make some traditional food for Easter this year. What I love most is a type of rich sweet bread called <code>kozunak</code>. The perfect kozunak is defined by many qualities, but what I find hardest is the texture. First, it should be really tender. Second, it must be very airy. Third, it should be juicy, not as dry as normal bread, but not doughy. Fourth, it should have threads. This means that the bread is broken instead of cut, and the dough should easily separate along lines made by pulling while kneading it. The best way to imagine that is to think of collagen-rich meat taken out of the slow cooker and pulled apart into its muscle fibers. Here is a picture of what the threads should look like (I hope the colours of the original are off, else it isn't the perfect kozunak with that colour ;) and the crumb is denser than usual). </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YYtxM.jpg"" alt=""Kozunak""></p>

<p>The ratio of the recipe is probably important. It is a very wet dough for yeast, and has enough fat to make a quiche envious. (Also, this is the only bread I know of which is kneaded in oil instead of flour to prevent sticking). A typical recipe is: </p>

<pre>1 kg flour [assume all purpose] 
55 g live yeast 
300 g white sugar 
250 g milk [can be partially or wholly substituted for cream] 
250 g butter 
8 eggs 
lemon rind, zests 
vanilla extract 
1 tbsp rum
yolk for glazing
raisins (optional)
almonds (optional)
</pre>

<p>I am not very good at getting it this way, because there is at least a year between each of my tries, meaning that I don't remember what I did when it went good and when it went wrong. My grandma and all of her friends love to give ""surefire advice"" on how to get it that way. And the advice of one friend contradicts that of another one (if it isn't internally inconsistent at to start with). I think that you SeasonedAdvicers are less likely to just perpetuate old myths without understanding them than these nice old ladies. So if you are experienced with yeast doughs, I will appreciate your opinion on following factors. </p>

<ol>
<li>Fat type. This recipe says butter, but there is lots of advice to use lard instead, to make it ""more tender"". I am not sure that this has any consequence in yeast dough, probably some well-intentioned home cook decided that if it works for pie crust, it works for bread too. But I'd like to hear your opinion. </li>
<li>How many times should I let it rise? The usual procedure is something like Rise yeast in milk - mix everything, knead - rise (ca. 2x volume) - knead - rise (ca. 3x volume) - knead, pull, braid - rise (ca. 2x volume) - bake. But some leave the middle rising out, letting rise a bit more the other times. Is it a simplification, or is the procedure outlined overkill? Are there disadvantages to that much rising? </li>
<li>How much should I knead it each time? Some say lots of kneading in the beginning, the least amount at the end. Others say that the least amount of kneading every time is best. What do you advice?  </li>
<li>Optimal oven temperature? It gets thick, because it increases in volume another 2x to 3x before setting, 10 cm isn't unusual. That would speak for a lower temp, around 160°C. But the years I followed this instinct, it got quite dry (maybe I didn't check properly for doneness). So maybe less time at a higher temp. But this is theory, what would an experienced baker suggest? </li>
</ol>

<p>I think that's about it, but if you have other useful suggestions, please tell. This type of dough has a reputation for being tricky (or is it just the fact that it is rarely made so home bakers are inexperienced? Or that the expectations on the final product are high?) and I'll check the theory again, but help from more experienced bakers would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Edit: maybe I didn't make it entirely clear what puzzles me most. As I see it, I need exuberant gluten formation for the threads (and the long rising supports this theory). But to make it tender and airy I'd think that I want less gluten. So the theory just confuses me this time. I hope that at least the juicy part is taken care of by the abundant fat. </p>

"Chicken curry in a slow cooker turns out watery <p>My first question on here, so please go easy on me.   </p>

<p>I have recently got a slow cooker and have been very pleased with the results, but that was using ready-made sachets of cooking mixes. </p>

<p>I am now trying to cook things properly from scratch but I think I'm missing something important. </p>

<p>This is the recipe I have used for chicken curry:- </p>

<ul>
<li>4 chicken thighs</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves </li>
<li>2 large onions </li>
<li>1 green pepper</li>
<li>1 red pepper</li>
<li>handful chopped spinach</li>

<li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>250ml chicken stock </li>
<li>3 heaped tsp of curry spice</li>
</ul>

<p>I put everything in the slow cooker, give it a good stir, and then leave it to cook. It tastes nice, but the sauce is very watery. </p>

<p>I have used the same recipe in a pan and the sauce thickens after I simmer it for about 20 mins. </p>

"Perfect Hollandaise every time using a blender/food processor? <p>I was a cook at a cafe recently that was buying in Hollandaise. I started making the sauce from scratch following the same basic procedure each time but got varying results. sometimes the Hollandaise would be too thick; more like a butter spread than a sauce. Then, for a real long stretch right up til I got my current office gig, the stuff wouldn't thicken at all and just stayed runny.</p>

<p>This is the procedure i followed every time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Melt half a pound of butter in the microwave</li>
<li>Carefully separate 2 eggs</li>
<li>Add egg yolks to blender and blend until aerated</li>
<li>Add capful of white vinegar</li>
<li>Add pinch of salt</li>
<li>Slowly add melted butter</li>

"Does cooking raw meat/poulty extend its shelf life? <p>I pulled a chicken out of the freezer a couple of days ago with the intention of making stock/soup.

"Why does the roux separate from my gumbo? <p>I love gumbo, and make it about once or twice a month. However, I've noticed that my roux will occasionally separate from my stew and float up to the surface. I've sampled it, just to see if it had absorbed some of the flavors, but all I got was a floury taste. </p>

<p>I've had gumbo enough times to know that this shouldn't be happening - the roux should be enriching the flavor of the stew and mixing in, but it isn't.</p>

<p>A rough outline of what I do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make roux with vegetable oil and flour in a 1:1 ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix in bell pepper, celery, and onions (aka ""trinity""); stir frequently for 10-20 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix in garlic, cayenne pepper; stir for two minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix in thyme, bay leaves, white wine; bring to boil.</p></li>
<li><p>Add chicken, andouille, shrimp, tomatoes, clam juice, chicken broth; bring to boil and simmer for 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Add okra; simmer for 10 minutes or until ready to serve.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's some thoughts on possible problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I usually cook it in a slow cooker once I have all the ingredients simmering. I've only cooked it the conventional way (read: in a pot) once, and it didn't separate. (When I cooked it in the pot, some of the roux was in the stew that boiled off the top of the lid; a tasting revealed that it was more flavorful than the stew).</li>
</ol>

<p><strike>2. I've sometimes gotten lazy or been in a rush, so I only cook the trinity for 10 minutes instead of the full 20. (I've also noticed that the trinity gets uncomfortably slimy-looking after the 10 minutes, which has prompted me to prematurely move to the next step on a few occasions.)</strike></p>

<p>And finally, an error I am <em>not</em> making: I am not burning the roux. It may smell smoky, but it is not burned.</p>

<p>Given this, what could be the cause?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've just made it again, and it's definitely not because I'm undercooking the trinity. Based on the evidence, I'm going to go with Sobachatina's answer, until I can try it again.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Forgot to update this until I got pinged about a change on this question. The slow cooker made the roux separate from the gumbo; it has never separated from the stew when cooked in a pot, likely because the starch doesn't fully gelatinize when in the slow cooker. If anyone wants to look further and try to figure out <em>when</em> the starch is sufficiently gelatinized, drop a comment below with your result and I'll update this solution.</p>

"What can I use instead of corn syrup? <p>I saw the question about <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/uk-alternative-to-corn-syrup"">UK</a>, but I don't think I can find treacle of any kind in Germany.</p>

<p>I am looking for a substitute which will keep the physical qualities of the pie filling reasonably close to the original. I don't mind if the sweetness changes (in fact, I'd probably like it if it is less sweet than the original) and I don't mind introducing new aromas into the recipe. </p>

<p>My first idea was to make a very light caramel, and eventually keep it sticky with a dash of lemon juice. Then I could probably try to solve sugar in maple syrup, which will also introduce a new flavor and also keep it sweet. </p>

<p>Probably the closest thing to real corn syrup sold in the supermarket here is beet sugar syrup. But it isn't high on my list, because I probably won't use the rest up. </p>

<p>I also plan to use walnuts instead of pecans, if it makes any difference (pecans are quite rare here too). </p>

"Charles Darwin high altitude cooking of potatoes <p>I just read about Charles Darwin's attempt to boil potatoes while at high altitudes. 
In The Voyage of the Beagle you can read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having crossed the Peuquenes [Piuquenes], we descended into a mountainous country, intermediate between the two main ranges, and then took up our quarters for the night. We were now in the republic of Mendoza. The elevation was probably not under 11,000 feet [...]. At the place where we slept water necessarily boiled, from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, at a lower temperature than it does in a less lofty country; the case being the converse of that of a Papin's digester. Hence the potatoes, after remaining for some hours in the boiling water, were nearly as hard as ever. The pot was left on the fire all night, and next morning it was boiled again, but yet the potatoes were not cooked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At that altitude the boiling temperature should be around 88°C depending on local variance and weather, but as far as I know that should be more than enough to break down the starch and pectin in a potato. There are a number of sous vide recipes which states that you can boil potatoes at 87°C or even lower.</p>

"What Makes Bread Gray? <p>I've been baking French-style bread loaves (not baguettes) for years.  The ingredients are flour, salt, water, yeast, and about one tbsp cornstarch per cup of flour.  For the last year or so, the inside of the loaves has sometimes been gray rather than white, but with little or no change in the taste.  I have not changed ingredients nor preparation technique.  Flour has been King Arthur bread flour for years.  I am at a loss to explain the change.  </p>

<p>I'm in Atlanta, about 1,000 feet above sea level.  Earlier this summer, I made bread every day for two weeks at a beach house party, using equipment and ingredients brought from home.  Every loaf turned out perfect, with no hint of gray.  I have no idea why that might make a difference.  (There's an electric oven at the beach, gas at home, but I made perfect, or at least white, bread with the gas oven for many years before this problem started.)</p>

<p>Also, if I cut into a loaf right after it comes from the oven, it's always white.  The graying process seems to happen over a couple of hours.  (I bake in the afternoon for an evening dinner.)</p>

"Emulsifying ingredients for vinaigrettes <p>My weekday vinaigrette recipe goes something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 part olive oil</li>
<li>1.5-2 parts seasoned rice vinegar</li>
<li>dollop of Dijon mustard</li>
<li>put into sealed container, shake, pour</li>
</ul>

<p>This emulsifies nicely thanks to the mustard, allowing for quick and easy preparation (instead of a laborious whisking of oil a drop at a time).</p>

<p>I'd like to try other flavors for salad dressing.  In particular, I'd like to make some sesame oil + soy sauce + rice vinegar dressings, and the Dijon mustard would be out of place.</p>

"Does oxidation inhibit caramelization? <p>Getting ready to make some fried plantains, but I wanted to get a jump on prep before caramelizing in place (approximately 2 hours from prep).

<p>It is possible to prevent oxidation of bananas and plantains with use of an acidulated water soak for three to five minutes, then pat dry. However, the plantains are a bit too ripe and soft to be able to pat dry without either leaving behind paper bits or mussing the surface of the fruit.</p>

"What are good techniques to prepare liver? <p>I don't like liver, but now I have to start eating pork liver because of its high iron content. </p>

<p>There are some ingredients which I have disliked for years, then suddenly started liking when I discovered how tasty they can be when prepared properly. An example is an aubergine: throw it into a stew as it is, or deep fry it so it soaks up three times its way in oil, and I don't want to see it. Blanch it to reduce the bitterness, dry it before it touches fat, combine it with rosemary, and it becomes one of the best veggies ever. </p>

<p>I was wondering whether there is some cooking technique which transforms liver into a lovely treat. My biggest issues with liver are </p>

<p>
 <li> the texture, which is too crumbly, almost sandy, and a bit dry 
 <li> the intensity of its earthy, fatty, almost rancid flavor. 
</li></p>

<p>At least, it tastes that way when my mother or grandmother prepare it, I have never eaten it in a restaurant. </p>

<p>Do you know a way to mitigate these problems? Advice on good combinations, be it side dishes or herbs/spices, is also appreciated. Also, what is the optimal pH range? I'd tend to use some acidic components because of the fatty flavor (e.g. make a sauce by deglazing the pan with lemon juice), but is this really a good combination, and how does it affect the texture if the acid is added while preparing?</p>

"Mysterious Disintegrating Udon noodles <p>A few weeks ago, I had a very strange experience making udon noodles. Almost instantly after adding the dried noodles to boiling water, and giving a slight stir, they began to break apart. After a few minutes, there was not a single piece longer than one inch. They didn't taste much like udon either, as they were not in the least bit plump or firm.</p>

<p>This was a different brand than I've used before, and they were labeled ""organic"". We assumed they were just bad noodles (they tasted somewhat of soggy cardboard), and threw them out.</p>

<p>Last night, I was trying to make udon once again, from a different pack (of a different brand). The same thing happened: noodles broke up, and tasted bland and mushy. The only thing this brand had in common with the previous pack is that they are both labeled ""organic"", and they were both in a cabinet for several months. One brand was American, but the other label was mostly in Korean. Also, I think my wife bought both of these packages, whereas I've always bought them before.</p>

<p>So, my multipart question is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Has anyone had this happen with <em>any</em> kind of noodle before? Any explanation?</li>
<li>Is there some difference in ""organic"" udon that makes it do this? Some additive that is omitted? I don't have another package in front of me right now to compare, but my two failed packages only contain wheat flour and salt. How could that be wrong?</li>
<li>Could the age of the noodles caused this? I've never seen old spaghetti noodles fall apart like this...</li>
<li>Should my wife be banned from buying udon noodles?</li>

"What order should I add ingredients when making soup? <p>I am a student with no cooking experience and a very low budget. The former forces me to cook as cheap as possible and I think soups in general are the most cost efficient meals out there, since they can be cooked in large amounts and stored for a long time. But the problem is, I have very little idea of how to make a soup. </p>

<p>So far I know how to make a basic meat and vegetable soup/stew:</p>

<p>1) Stew some kind of meat</p>

<p>2) Chop some veggies, saute some of them in a pan with oil or butter.</p>

<p>3) Add the bouillon from the 1st step and some other veggies. Add the meat from the 1st step too.</p>

<p>4) Add some spices and cook for 1-2 hours. </p>

<p>1) In what order should I saute the first veggies (for example, garlic onion and carrots) ? How long do I need to cook them for?</p>

<p>2) When I add the bouillon and the rest of the vegetables, should I add the longer cooking ones first, or cut them into smaller pieces? Suppose I'm using potatoes, beans, celery, and parsley. Obviously the potatoes require more time then parsley. So how should I do this? (Should I cook harder vegetables longer, or cut them into finer pieces?)</p>

<p>3) When should I add the meat?</p>

<p>4) If I want to thicken it with starch, when should I add it?</p>

"How to make salt in burger permeate throughout the entire meat? <p>I have been eating beef burgers from various different shops however having asked them they ALL use the exact same brand and product.  Here in east london uk they also all use a standard flat top grill(basically a rectangle pan).  I have noticed that when I eat at one shop in particular it always comes out very salty wheares it isn't like this for other shops.  I even bought some raw burgers from the salty shop and cooked them at home and it didn't taste salty.  They recently closed for a few days and having now reopened there burgers no longer taste salty but just like all the other shops selling the same burger.  My gues is that they reset or changed something which was allowing the burger to be salty once cooked.  It cooked be that there is an optimal grill temperature to make the salt permeate.  it could be that there fridge temperature was low and this allows the burgers to brine.  It could have been something else.</p>

<p>Do you know why, what makes the burger taste so salty.  It cannot be a bacth issue as the shop has produced the same results for several months until they closed. Also they all sell the same burgers and the burgers have 2grams.  Do you know what factor might cause the salt to permeate into the meats tissues so well which shows in the final burger?</p>

"Uncovered Raw Meat or Milk in Fridge <p>I believe the harm in leaving raw meat uncovered in the fridge is that more bacteria will enter, more oxygen will enter (causing faster bacteria multiplication), and more water will escape (causing dryness which probably slows bacteria multiplication, but toughens the meat, so let's consider dryness to be bad; I'm not making beef jerky).

"Does adding brandy to whipped cream make it fall quicker? <p>I make whipped cream frequently, but this was the first time I added ""real"" alcohol, and it fell within 20 minutes.  I put both the bowl and beaters in the freezer until cold.  Then, I whip heavy whipping cream by hand mixer until stiff peaks form.  I mix in sugar on a 1:3 or 1:6 ratio (depending on dessert) and add 1 Tbs flavoring per 1 cup cream.  Generally, it stays in the fridge for a few days before falling, but when I added brandy, it fell within twenty minutes.  I wasn't expecting it, since I have no trouble with Bailey's or Amaretto. Is this normal, or did I perhaps mess up somewhere else in the prep?  I'd like another stab at making brandy snaps, but I'm nervous about fallen cream with all the work that goes into the cookies.</p>

"Why are wire beaters becoming more common in hand mixers? <p>It seemed to me that most hand mixers in the past used centre post beaters.  They seemed more sturdy and durable, thicker construction.

<p>However I was wondering why most are now moving towards wire beaters?  </p>

"Is it a known technique to serve hot crispy-crust sandwiches on edge? <p>So, I'm not a chef and there are few foods I'm good at cooking. Grilled sandwiches, however, I would say are one of these few. Of course, for such sandwiches, with grilled or toasted bread, the crispness of the bread from toasting or grilling is a major component of the food experience. However, I have found that serving a sandwich the standard way, with on bread slice down, often results in a severe reduction in crispness, especially if the sandwich contains meat or other juicy items. Even if the sandwich insides are not so juicy, like for a grilled cheese, the release of water vapor due to the fact that the sandwich is hot, and having it trapped there between the sandwich and the plate, is enough to completely nullify the crispness of that piece of bread.</p>

<p>My personal solution to this is to cut the sandwich, typically diagonally, and plate it with the cut side down, so as to allow the release of water vapor to the air, and to mitigate juices going straight to the bread. I have found this to work quite well, as long as the sandwich is one that basically holds itself together decently well. (a toothpick can help.)</p>

<p>My question is whether this is a known plating technique for sandwiches, where the purpose of such plating is to maintain bread texture properties.</p>

"Are there any calories in roasted coffee beans? Why is black coffee 0 kcal? <p><strong>Are there any calories in roasted coffee beans?</strong></p>

<p><strong>And why do they seem to 'disappear' when turned into black coffee?</strong></p>

According to some websites, there are (I've seen values between 300 and 400 kcal per 100 g).</p>

<p>Where do all the calories of the coffee beans go when they turn into black coffee?</p>

<p>I read that when coffee is filtered (with paper filters), some oils are absorbed in the filter. But this alone does not seem enough to account for the missing calories. Also note that although the nutrition facts for black coffee are 'diluted' (i.e. it's expected they would be a lot less than the actual coffee in powder form, because there's water added), that is also not enough to bring the value to 0 kcal (however the rounding is performed).</p>

"Some tahini tastes very salty, other tahini does not. Why? <p>I have bought several jars of tahini from different companies lately. All labels say, that they contain 100% hulled sesame seeds with no preservatives or artifical flavours added.</p>

<p>I am successfully controlling my temperature by turning the fridge on and off via a temperature controller, but the humidity is driving me mad.I cannot seem to get it lower than 85-80%, even with a humidity controller turning a light on to raise the temperature, so the compressor runs more frequently. This does lower the humidity, but as soon as the compressor turns off, the humidity is straight back up to 85%, and this is with no food in it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that as a salami dries it will release moisture it loses into the atmosphere of the fridge, increasing the humidity.

Ive got a 3kg tray of salt in the bottom which I swap daily and dry the removed tray in the oven.  I'd really appreciate any help on this.</p>

<p>It might be due to the following cases</p>

<ol>
<li>We used oversized cookware which was actually sitting on the raised edge of the stove and perhaps not actually touching the glass surface.</li>
<li>On a different occasion we used a different situation we used a vessal with a smaller base than the smaller circle, and thus possibly the edges of the circle got overheated or something.. </li>

I recently noticed that I've been using the same bottle for months... is there any issue with this? Any mold concerns, etc? Or can I keep using it indefinitely?</p>

"White stains & muddy deposits in stainless steel pots <p>I use stainless steel pots on an induction cooker for boiling water for preparing food for an infant. I use bottled and supposedly clear and soft water.</p>

<p>When I pour the water into the pot it is crystal clear. I noticed that after boiling it's not that clear anymore. It's somewhat muddy and has visible whitish deposits.</p>

"Adding rolled-in seasonings to pita bread <p>Usually when I make flatbread, I roll-in seasonings (ie: minced garlic and celery) before cooking. There doesn't seem to be a problem with the dough being too wet or doughy if I only use about a teaspoon of seasoning per ball, and only roll the seasoning into the dough once or twice. </p>

<p>The rolled-in seasonings are my favorite part about flatbread- I prefer the thickness and fluffiness of pita much more. I tried combining the two by using my favorite pita recipe and rolling in seasonings before cooking. This completely changed the texture of my pita, and ended up a doughy mess (ie: it was slimy while cooking and tasted too wet after coming off the skillet- pockets did not form at all). </p>

<p>Has anyone tried this with different results, or found a way to successfully add seasonings into pita dough with real pita bread results? Or is it a lost cause? I'm wondering why it continually works with flatbread dough but not with pita. </p>

"Modernist Cuisine-style BBQ brisket safety <p>I am going to try Nathan Myhrvold's 2-step BBQ brisket recipe: Smoke at 149F for 7 hrs, then vacuum seal and sous vide at 146F for 72 hrs. However, (due to travel for work) I won't be able to complete these steps in the consecutive days leading up to the party.</p>

After smoking, I would wait for it to cool just enough to vacuum seal, rapidly chill in an ice bath, and refrigerate until I return and start the sous vide bath. Can I be confident that a 10-12 lb brisket, after 7 hrs at 149F, will have reduced enough pathogens to be safe to refrigerate for 3 days? Or more practically, will it be safe to eat after 3 days refrigeration followed by 72 hours in a sous vide bath at 146F?</p>

"Flavored caramelization <p>When should flavorings to brown sugar-caramel be added: during caramelization of after?</p>

"Can I make any modern improvements to this Russian cake recipe from 1971? <p>I found a recipe in a 1971 Russian booklet on holiday recipes, (see it below).  I translated it to English.  My questions about the recipe will be these:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>are there any advancements known to culinary science that will bring this recipe to 21st century? 
(I am thinking of things like mixing egg yolks and egg whites separately, mixing liquid and dry ingredients separately, use of baking soda vs baking powder, when to put ingredients together in what order, baking it at what temperature and so on, or is it fine as-is?)</p></li>
<li><p>there is no temperature listed at which it is to be baked, but I am guessing 180C</p></li>
<li><p>it mentions crushing star anise and cloves.  Do I use the old methods and crush them in a mortar and pestle?  Or do I use ... a blender?  I do have the spices in whole uncrushed form.</p></li>
<li><p>in a word, can I make improvements to this cake, to make it better, without changing its authenticity?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Recipe</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 eggs</p></li>
<li><p>200 grams of butter or margarine (1 cup or vegetable oil, better
corn)</p></li>
<li><p>2 cups sugar</p></li>
<li><p>1 cup of thick (candied) jam</p></li>
<li><p>2 cups of buttermilk or yogurt</p></li>
<li><p>1 teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, star anise (crushed) </p></li>
<li><p>1 teaspoon baking soda </p></li>
<li><p>about 4 cups flour</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Mix eggs with sugar, add the butter, jam, crushed spices, sour milk. </p>

<p>Pour baking soda and flour (flour pour as much as necessary to achieve consistency similar to a thick porridge).</p>

<p>Prepare the form (line bottom with oiled parchment, well-lubricate the entire form and sprinkle it with flour), put it in the mix, filling in the form only as much as 3/4 since the cake will rises. </p>

<p>Bake the cake on low heat in the oven.</p>

<p>Note. You can add chopped and sugared lemon and orange peel, raisins, nuts. If you do not have all of these spices, you can restrict it to 1 1/2 teaspoon of crushed cloves. Instead of jam you can try putting in the same amount honey or preserves. This cake should be kept in cool place, wrapped in a wet cloth and a plastic bag. Thus it can be stored even 2 weeks, but when it is necessary to change the cloth.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I tried baking it today with brown sugar, butter, plum jam and I put just a tad much flour (just under 4 cups which I put in right away), which I compensates with half a cup more buttermilk since the dough was too dense. Then I had it in the oven for about an hour at 180F, but it turned out heavy soggy and a little bit tasteless, despite me pulling it out after a toothpic stuck in the center of cake came out dry.</p>

<p>Next time I will try less flour and white sugar, or maybe even splenda, and olive oil instead of butter.  And I will bake it for longer and I might just bake it at something closer to 350F.</p>

"LinkedIn in-app browser forcing video to fullscreen on iPhone <p>We are using LinkedIn to share a link to an HTML5 interactive video. When the link is shared, by default it opens in LinkedIn's browser inside the app. The problem is that when the user starts playing the video, the browser automatically switches to fullscreen, hiding our custom controls. iOS allows inline video playback nowadays with <em>playsinline</em> attribute on the video element, but LinkedIn browser doesn't support the attribute. On iPad the video does play inline though and does not switch to fullscreen. We have tested this bug on iOS versions 10 and 11. On native Safari browser or Google Chrome there's no problem, the video plays inline as intended. The video plays inline in other apps, for example Facebook Messenger's in-app browser. The only problem we have had is with the LinkedIn browser.</p>

<p>Is there any way to play a video inline on iPhone when using the in-app browser without going fullscreen? Or, is there any url scheme that could be used to launch Safari from the in-app browser? Currently the user experience is quite bad when the users have to manually exit fullscreen, which also pauses the video.</p>

EmployeeID|EventCode|Excuse_DurationFrom|Excuse Duration To|Any specific Detailment

Here EmployeeID and ExcusedForEventCode are both composite primary keys as it is possible to have same employeeId for multiple excuses,but the combination is always unique.

We have built some custom attendance management system and would require the following details:

1.We need to find all those employees who are neither accounted for nor excused for a specific event(this will be provided through front end) for a time duration selected through the front end.
2.The result of the above query will subsequently be used to compare with a biometric attendance machine logs which gives 
EmployeeId|LogDate(datetime)|EventCodes as a separate table input to our database.(Mastertable A employeeId references this EmployeeId as foreign key)

It will be compared to find out true absentees for a particular event.ie All those employees who are neither accounted for,nor excuses for any particular event and who does not figure out in the biometric scan machine logs are absented for those time duration selected.We need the output of absentee like this
EmployeeId|Employee Designation|Employee Name|EventName(Have a separate table linking with EventCode)|Date&time(This would be per day per event report of employee who are absent from the selected time duration).

We have tried queries like:

select employeemastertable.employeeid,employeemastertable.Designation,employeemastertable.Name,EventCodes.EventCodeName as Eventexcusedfrom from employeemastertable inner join employeeexcusedforevents on employeemastertable.employeeid=employeeexcusedforevents.employeeid inner join EventCodes on employeeexcusedforEvents.ExcusedForEventCode=EventCodes.Eventcode left  join employeeaccountedFor on employeemastertable.employeeid=employeeaccountedFor.employeeid where employeeexcusedforevents.ExcusedForEventCode!=1(Morning conference) and employeeaccountedFor.employeeid is null;

Names have been changed

I do understand this will give those employees who does not figure out in event Morning conference but even if i do left join instead of inner join between employeemastertable and employeeexcusedForevents and put employeeexcusedforevents.excusedforeventcode is null and employeeexcusedforevents.employeeid is null,i do get all those employees not present in the other two table,but the criteria of event is not satisfied.That means what if the employee is excused for the 2nd event as well in the organization.How would i cater for that in the above code?(PS this is only the 1st part of the equation i understand that,after this i need help for the other part also,where time duration and comparing with logs is concerned)?

Key names are similar in JSON A and JSON B . We can see, `subgroup 3` and `subgroup 4` are only present in `grp 4` and `grp 3` respectively (look into JSON B). I want to add each `subgroup` from JSON B into each `grp` in JSON A (except the `grp` s where those `subgroup` s are already present. Like in JSON A there is an entry with `subgroup 3` and `grp 4`, we will skip that.). Value of `Id`, `power` will be similar respectively. So, we want to add `subgroup 3` in the `grp 1, 2, 3` and add `subgroup 4` in the `group 1, 2, 4` . For `subgroup 3`, `power` and `id` value will be `2, 1` respectively and for `subgroup 4`, `power` and `id` value will be `1, 1` respectively.

Final JSON A output should be,

    		""id"": 1,
    		""subgroup"": ""1"",

i believe the reason it fails to parse is that the payload variable ends witth a trailing newline character. i then attempted `payload = payload.trim();` but then i get `no match for 'operator=' (operand types are 'String' and 'void')` so i tried `payload = payload.replace(""\n,"""");` same issue, then i tried `payload = String(payload);` again, failure. what am i doing wrong?",4

"iOS 10: How to debug a Today Widget - ""Unable to load"" message <p>It seems to me that whenever a Today Widget crashes for any reason it displays the ""Unable to load"" message (as on the attached screen).</p>

<p>When this happens nothing kicks off in the debugger, nothing appears on the Console. It seems to me like searching for a needle in the haystack. Is it possibl to debug the ""Unable to load"" message in Xcode in any way?</p>

<p>Xcode version: 8.2</p>

"Definition of Undefined behaviour <p>I have read on <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Undefined Behavior"">cppreference</a> about Undefined behavior and understand the differences. What I didn't find though is what is implicit.</p>

<p>I would expect any behavior that is not explicitly defined to be unspecified behavior. But when I tried to find what <code>t</code> means in <code>fopen</code>'s format string, there was nothing in the <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fopen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""fopen"">cppreference</a> on it and nowhere does it state that it is implementation defined.

<p>On the other hand <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""fopen"">msdn</a> defines among others the <code>t</code> parameter so that would mean that any behavior not explicitly stated as undefined can be implementation defined? Or is the cppreference just missing a sentence and I'm only chasing ghosts?</p>

<p>I guess what the question boils down for me is, if there is nothing written about something, what is it, undefined or implementation defined behavior?</p>

"Keras Conv2D and input channels <p>The Keras layer documentation specifies the input and output sizes for convolutional layers:
<a href=""https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/</a></p>

<p>Input shape: <code>(samples, channels, rows, cols)</code></p>

<p>Output shape: <code>(samples, filters, new_rows, new_cols)</code></p>

<p>And the kernel size is a spatial parameter, i.e. detemines only width and height.</p>

<p>So an input with <code>c</code> channels will yield an output with <code>filters</code> channels regardless of the value of <code>c</code>. It must therefore apply 2D convolution with a spatial <code>height x width</code> filter and then aggregate the results somehow for each learned filter. </p>

<p>What is this aggregation operator? is it a summation across channels? can I control it? I couldn't find any information on the Keras documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note that in TensorFlow the filters are specified in the depth channel as well:
<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution</a>,
So the depth operation is clear.</li>
</ul>

"Root access for Jupyter/iPython Notebook <p>I'm trying to use the bash kernel in iPython/Jupyter notebook, but I need sudo access within the notebook itself.</p>

<p>I've tried <code>$ sudo jupyter notebook</code> to run the notebook as root, but that only returns:</p>

<pre><code>$ jupyter: 'notebook' is not a Jupyter command
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm left with running <code>$ jupyter notebook</code> (unless there's a way to run Jupyter notebook as root).</p>

<p>I also can't do <code>su root</code> in the notebook itself because that requires an input and the notebook won't let me give an input.</p>

<p>Finally, there is allegedly an <code>--allow-root</code> option for Jupyter notebook:

"Is SSRS more friendly to SQL users than Crystal Reports? <p>So our ERP system has fairly limited SQL reporting tools, although it's pure SQL, write a query in a window, execute, and a report pops up.  Problem is, it's quite error filled, the exports are hideous and anything over 2,000 records may not display correctly.</p>

<p>So we decided to get Crystal Reports and frankly I hate the damn thing.  My SQL skills are practically of no use with this thing because everything is done with a report writer and you can't even edit basic SQL statements, you have to go through all these stupid hoops and loops just to make a basic change in your report.  I'm used to deleting a column name from my SQL statement, refresh, and boom, column gone.  In Crystal, deleting a column seems near impossible in an existing report, I spent like an hour researching and came up with nothing.  Every little task in Crystal seems to be ridiculously over complicated.</p>

<p>Basically, I just want a blank window where I can type real SQL code and get a damn report.  Can SSRS do this simple task?  I really don't give a damn about formatting, I just want data</p>

"Can't understand how c++ set works I am using c++ stl set class for a leetcode question. from googlein I heard set keeps the elements in ordered manner and I heard that set.begin() returns the smallest element. But I also heard set uses red black trees and has log(n) time complexity. I don't understand how these two can go together, as in how does set.begin() return smallest element when a redblack tree doesn't guarantee the smallest element will be the head. Also set.begin() function makes it seem like this container uses an array instead of a linked list to build the redblack tree, which again I don't understand how an array can be used instead of a tree.Can someone explain me the implementation of c++ set?

"Using classes vs constructor functions in TypeScript I am starting to write my first little app in TypeScript. Before, I did a lot of reading on the JavaScript classes and how *bad* and *fake* they are in JavaScript. That's why I decided to use good old constructor functions in my TS application, but after I wrote my first interface, a problem arose - how do I implement it in my constructor function?

Let's say I have an interface:
```
interface WebScraper {
  url: string,
  getRawContent(): string,
}
```

when I used classes I would simply code

```
class Scraper implements WebScraper {
  //...
}
```

but how do I do it for a constructor function? I will be using it with the `new` keyword so it will return an object with specific properties. Would that be correct then, if I specify the interface as the return type?

```
function Scraper(): WebScraper {
  //...
}
```

I actually tried that and got an error
```
error TS2355: A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.

        jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.
        The application must also be compiled with debugging
        enabled.
        
        For example:
        
        <configuration>
            <system.windows.forms jitDebugging=""true"" />
        </configuration>
        
        When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception
        will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer
        rather than be handled by this dialog box.

I managed a good enough approximation: In a media query selecting all screens that <em>might</em> need wrapping, I change the <code>order</code> of the B container to something big, and at the same time, I set its <code>min-width</code> to 100% which forces the wrap.</p>

"What precautions and warnings should we know about, when using the new ""APK Signature Scheme v2""? <h2>Background</h2>

<p>Recently, when I was about to sign my APK to be published to the Play Store, I got this new option:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nvk9B.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nvk9B.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Pressing on the ""Signature help"" link, opened this webpage:
<a href=""https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0.html#apk_signature_v2"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0.html#apk_signature_v2</a></p>

<p>Searching more, I've found this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/2016/11/understanding-apk-packaging-in-android-studio-2-2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/2016/11/understanding-apk-packaging-in-android-studio-2-2.html</a></p>

<p>It turns out that it's a new verification on Android 7.x, which can help make the APK more secure, yet also a bit smaller in size.</p>

<p>I tried using this new feature, and as was written on the blog, it does make the APK a bit smaller. Also, as it was written, it's meant only on Android 7.x and above (yet you can actually sign using both methods on the same APK, letting you install the app on older versions of Android too).</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I don't understand if it's safe to use the new signing mechanism, and what exactly they warn about on the docs. </p>

<p>There is at least one warning I've read that I don't think needs special care for most develoeprs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caution: If you sign your app using APK Signature Scheme v2 and make
  further changes to the app, the app's signature is invalidated. For
  this reason, use tools such as zipalign before signing your app using
  APK Signature Scheme v2, not after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I can ignore this warning, because I just let the IDE itself build the APK using the default build behavior. </p>

<h2>What I tried</h2>

<p>I tried using all 3 ways to sign the app:</p>

<ul>
<li>v1</li>
<li>v2</li>
<li>v1 &amp; v2 (together in a single APK)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that v2 alone cannot be installed on pre-7.x versions of Android, yet the rest can, and it also seems that v2 is smaller than v1, while v1&amp;v2 is a really tiny bit larger than v1 . </p>

<h2>The questions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it safe to switch from the old signing to the new one (Enabling both signing of course) ? </p></li>
<li><p>Will users have any issues upgrading? Will users upgrading from v1 to v2, or from v2 (or v1&amp;v2) to v1 (in case something went wrong) - have any issues?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I know about any warnings? Was I right that I can ignore the warning I've mentioned?</p></li>
<li><p>Aside from better security, what does signing using v1&amp;v2 (together) provide, that I don't have on v1 ?</p></li>
<li><p>My guess is that only from Android 7, we will be able to use just v2, which provides a way for having smaller APKs. Is it true?</p></li>

"Do we have any possibility to stop request in OkHttp Interceptor? <p>In our app we met with one special case - if our <code>App.specialFlag == true</code>, we need stop any request from our code. And we think, that the best approach in this situation is include special <code>Interceptor</code> which will stop any our requests, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (App.specialFlag) {
    // Somehow stop request
} else {
    return chain.proceed(chain.request());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, we should note, that we use <code>RxJavaCallAdapterFactory</code> for wrapping responses into <code>Observable</code>s.</p>

<p>But we don't see any methods for stopping request in OkHttp Interceptors. </p>

<p>We came up with two ways to solve our issue:</p>

<p>a) Create special <code>ApiService.class</code> for wrapping every request in our API like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Observable&lt;User&gt; getUserDetails() {
    if (App.specialFlag) {
        return Observable.just(null);
    }
    return api.getUserDetails();
}

<p>But we think that it is ugly and cumbersome solution.</p>

<p>b) Throw a <code>RuntimeException</code> in Interceptor, then catch it in every place we use our API. </p>

<p>The second solution is also not good, because we need to include a lot of <code>onErrorResumeNext</code> operators in our chains.</p>

"How to calculate percentages based on 'weight'? <p>I would like to calculate/split percentages among an any number of people based on 'weights'.</p>

<p>Weight, in this case, is a modifier about how much does that person weigh in the splitting. We can set these weights before from 1 to 100, and the program should automatically split 100% between the people.</p>

<p>Here is the example what I'd like to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>Person 1 'weight': 100
Person 2 'weight': 10
Person 3 'weight': 100
Person 4 'weight': 100
</code></pre>

<p>And the result I'd need is:</p>

<pre><code>Person 1 : 32.26%
Person 2 : 3.23%
Person 3 : 32.26%
Person 4 : 32.26%
</code></pre>

<p>I know that it has something to do with proportions but can't think of how to calculate this. I'd like to do it inside a Javascript or PHP function.</p>

"select an element in an array depending of another element in the array <p>I've the following array and I would like to select the <strong>tier</strong> and the <strong>rank</strong> of the array <strong>where queueType is equal to RANKED_FLEX_TT</strong> or RANKED_SOLO_5x5 or RANKED_FLEX_SR.

"Checking for empty string in C++ alternatives <p>There are (at least :) two ways of checking if an string is empty in C++, in particular:</p>

<p>and</p>

"Whats about refs in consrtuctors when collection updates? I have constructor of some service:

So, if outside of object i change items count- what happens?
is `_items.Count()` change?

Because, at current version i use this:

    public void Work()
    {
     if(StaticClass.Items.Count()>5)//do some work

Where `StaticClass.Items` updates when outside items collection changes.
So, if i make this:

     var service=new Consrtuctor(StaticClass.Items);
    
And then i update `StaticClass.Items` elems - can i use actual _items.Count() value when `Work` method calls (by some timer)?
 
Or, should i use `ref` keyword?",4

    return arg;
}

let myIdentity: &lt;T&gt;(arg: T) =&gt; T = identity;

<p>The documentation states this is possible due to the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this line I'm still struggling to understand how the two are equivalent, is there any further documentation or explanation of what it means to be 'a call signature of an object literal type'.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I can't give any further explanation but I'm completely drawing a blank as to how the two are equivalent, to me the second type definition states that myIdentity should be an object?</p>

"Guess the Number The Goal: Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.

"Best Multithread Global Variable Management <p>I've looked at things like <code>std::atomic</code> (which doesn't work) and <code>std::mutex</code> (which is too much to manage) but nothing is working :( I'm using <code>std::thread</code> to create my threads, but I'm open to using <code>CreateThread()</code></p>

<p>Here is the scenario: I have a variable that is constantly being updated in one thread. (say it's an int which reflects some value like number of dollars the user has) In the other threads, I access this variable, but do not write to it (just read). What can I do for this?</p>

<p><code>std::atomic</code> doesn't store the information fast enough in the first thread, which results in really really broken values (say the user has $10, if I write $10 twice before <code>std::atomic</code> actually updates it, it'll be some obscure value like 28 million) - there's no ""variable save queue"" of any sort.</p>

"How can I make a FloatTensor with requires_grad=True from a numpy array using PyTorch 0.4.0? <p>Pytorch 0.4.0 introduced the merging on the Tensor and Variable classes. </p>

<pre><code>x = torch.ones(3, 4, requires_grad=True) 
</code></pre>

<p>and also set <code>requires_grad</code> to existing tensors</p>

<pre><code>existing_tensor.requires_grad_()

<p>I have tried the following three things to try and create a Tensor with <code>requires_grad=True</code> which give errors (where <code>x</code> is a numpy array):</p>

<p>The first is </p>

<pre><code>x = FloatTensor(x, requires_grad=True)

<p>which gives the error</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: new() received an invalid combination of arguments - got

"Java lottery game efficiency, swing <p>I believe this is not the kind of question I should be asking here so I apologize in advance. I have an exam in 2 days and the teacher that was supposed to give me a lesson clearing out all of my questions had to cancel, so now I have no one to ask. I am resolving an exam from last year, and one of the questions is to make a little java program where we pretty much simulate a lottery game of 6 numbers. My question is about efficiency, the exam is written on paper and I feel like if I was to write everything I typed on the computer I would not have enough time, we have 90 minutes and this is only one of the problems, swing is not my strong point so that leads me to think that I could write this in much fewer lines. The public instance variable 'key' is there to simulate a method from another class that generates a random key that we do not need to implement.

The challenge requires it to run under 2 seconds. Here are the results of mine:</p>

<pre><code>Function              Time           % over
std::find          -&gt; 7.410s         370.50%
std::count         -&gt; 7.881s         394.05%
std::binary_search -&gt; 14.050s        702.50%
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see my algorithm is 3x slower than the required algorithm. The bottlenecks are clearly those functions:</p>

<pre><code>Function               % of total time 
std::find          -&gt;  77.61%
std::count         -&gt;  80.80%
std::binary_search -&gt;  87.59%
</code></pre>

<p>But currently I have no better idea than to use <code>std::find</code> or similar functions. Does someone have a way/idea to optimize my code further? Or are there some obvious bottlenecks that I'm missing?</p>

"ATMEGA2560 using UART interrupt to control global flag I recently met a problem when I was playing with ATMEGA2560, and I really don't understand what's wrong with it.

The problem is : 
When I received some datas from USART , I tried to set a RxFlag that can active the if-statement in main loop. But it didn't work , till I uncommented the function before if-statement which may be a _delay_ms() or a printf().

It make no sense. 
What I remember is that I don't need those functions and it can still set the global variables to affect main loop.
Or is there any detail I had missed?

"Does aria-label prevent the inner content being read out by assistive devices? <p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN docs</a> say you should use <code>aria-label</code> like this:</p>

<p>I don't have access to a screenreader, but I've seen comments on Stack Overflow suggesting that an <code>aria-label</code> does not <em>replace</em> the inner content, it only <em>prefixes</em> it. So in the above case it would read out ""Close X"", which is obviously not ideal.</p>

<p>Is this true? If so, what's the solution? I'm guessing it would make sense to wrap the inner content with an <code>[aria-hidden=true]</code> element, like this:</p>

"Basemap with Python 3.5 Anaconda on Windows <p>I use Python 3.5 with latest version of Anaconda on Windows (64 bit). I wanted to install Basemap using <code>conda install basemap</code>. Apparently there is a conflict between Python 3 and basemap. After some googling indeed I found that basemap is not supported on Python 3 for Windows users (ex: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/TjAwi3ilQaU"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/TjAwi3ilQaU</a>).</p>

<p>For obvious reasons I do not want to downgrade to Python 2. What would then be the simplest alternative solution?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there an alternative package similar to basemap for ploting maps, etc.?</li>
<li>Should I use a second environment which uses Python 2 and basemap? I have never done that but it seems possible (<a href=""http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html</a>). Is it ""safe""? Should I install again all the other packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc.) on the second environment? </li>

"Can I have two storeys in a 16 foot space? <p>I'm in the process of closing on a house that has an unusually large crawlspace underneath the structure. The house is built on a relatively steep hillside and the frame of the house extends to the bottom of the hill below, giving an enclosed crawlspace.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram (with apologies for my MSPaint skills):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/J8e4G.png"" alt=""Elevation view of the house""></p>

<p>The crawlspace has approximately 4.9m (16.2 feet) of space between the concrete floor and the bottom of the timber frame supporting the ground floor. There are no stilts or other support structures in the main part of the crawlspace though there are in the other half.</p>

<p>Here's a photo on the inside:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tCN8U.jpg"" alt=""Photo showing the crawlspace""></p>

<p>I would like to have this basement finished by adding an internal staircase from the ground floor down to this area. I would like to split this space into two floors. I understand that each floor must have at least 7 feet of headroom, and I assume you'd want a foot of space between the two floors and plus another foot to account for space from the ceiling below the ground floor and the bottom floor's carpeting. That's 7+7+1+1 == 16 feet. So far so good, right?</p>

<p>During the house inspection, I asked the inspector how possible it would be to do the conversion and he said it would be impossible as you need at least 10 feet per floor, so the house is 4 feet too short to convert the crawlspace into two floors. He was also pessimistic about installing rooms (such as a toilet room or a small bedroom) on the area currently covered in black tarp. He said that converting the main area of the crawlspace (with the flat floor) is definitely possible, but I'd probably only be able to have a smaller area (with a 5 or 6-foot high ceiling, maybe) underneath the finished room suitable only as a storage area.</p>

<p>With references to suitable building regs and whatnot, is my inspector correct in saying I can only have 1 fully-finished floor, or can I still have two finished floors/storeys in the space?</p>

"Standard duty cycle of fridge compressor? <p>I have a refrigerator which has compressor duty cycle of about 50% percent.</p>

<p>It’s set on 2 out of 5 which is the highest setting. It basically works for 12-13 minutes and then it’s of for about 16 minutes, and then cycle repeats.</p>

<p>Is this OK value?</p>

<p>Quoting <a href=""http://www.kouba-cavallo.com/art/REFRIG7a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Targeting Refrigerators for Repair or Replacement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One can begin by recognizing two very common characteristics of most refrigerators.
  Over a broad range of models and vintages, the operating characteristics of properly operating
  refrigerators under reasonable temperature conditions appear the same. A refrigerator turns on,
  runs for a while, turns off and is off for a while. It then turns on again and the cycle repeats. A
  typical,steady-state cycle is about 40 minutes with the duty cycle, or per cent running time, being
  about 50 percent for standard temperature differences between the food compartment of the
  refrigerator and the room in which the refrigerator is placed.
   In other words, a typical, properly
  operating refrigerator runs about 20 minutes and is off 20 minutes.</p>

"Getting notified when things fail <p>There are a lot of things around the home which can be automated.  For instance, at certain times during the day lights get turned on, sprinkler systems run, and so forth.  Some of these operate based on time, while other operate based on need, such as pool auto-levelers, and sump pumps. However, some of these things are more important than others.  If a light burns out it is less important than if a water value fails to come on or shut off.  In an arid climate, a value failing to come on could kill a tree, while a valve failing to shut off could result in flooding an property damage.  A pump failing to shut off could cause a fire.</p>

<p>Yet when I look at these systems, I don't see anything obvious that stands out as an alert mechanism when things fail.

Yet when something does go wrong, I would like to know so the problem can be fixed ASAP.</p>

"Electric water boiler .. how is the system supposed to work? (UK) <p>I'm not from the UK and am used to water being heated on-demand by a gas heater.<br>
Having recently moved to London, the flat has electrical heating and I cannot figure out how I'm supposed to set this electric boiler system.</p>

<p>Here's some pictures to get an idea of what's there:<br>
- <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/6ASWnpS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/6ASWnpS.jpg</a> - the boiler and it's Control Unit (not sure what it's actually called)<br>
- <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/7OIgZu7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/7OIgZu7.jpg</a> - the Control Unit buttons and text</p>

<p>The control unit has a switch with positions <em>Off</em> and <em>Timed</em>.
There is also a boiler power switch labelled <em>Immersion</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Immersion</em> switch seems to turn the boiler on, as it starts making water noise when turned on and five minutes later I can get some hot water on the tap.</p>

<p>With the <em>Immersion</em> switch On, changing anything else on the Control Unit doesn't seem to have any effect. Again, when the <em>Immersion</em> switch is Off, there's no hot water, regardless of the Control Unit.</p>

<p>On the top side of the boiler, to the left of the <em>Important</em> label, is a valve which is itself labelled as <em>T&amp;P valve</em> and the label next to it refers to a <em>Temperature and Pressure release valve</em>.<br>
When I turn on the <em>Immersion</em> switch, water starts heating, but about 10 minutes later, water comes out of this <em>T&amp;P valve</em>. It's not dripping, it's actually running, I can't estimate the debit, but it's probably like a half-on tap, which to me seems like a lot.</p>

<p>The <em>Important</em> label says: If the <em>T&amp;P valve</em> is dripping (not running) to 1) Turn off mains water, 2) Open a tap, 3) Hold the valve open until it stops making noise, 4) Turn off tap and mains water back on. </p>

<p>I've tried turning on the <em>Immersion</em> switch, waiting 10 minutes, water would come out of the <em>T&amp;P valve</em> and then I've turned on the shower. The shower was warm, but not boiling hot,  and the water turned to completely cold in about 3 minutes. After this point, the <em>T&amp;P valve</em> still had water running out.</p>

<p>After I turn off the <em>Immersion</em> switch, the valve will stop in a few minutes.</p>

"What do I use to mount a heavy framed mirror to a stud wall? <p>I recently got my grubby hands on a beautiful, but extremely heavy, 4' x 7' framed wall mirror; it probably weighs around 100lbs, if not a little more.</p>

<p>I know what (exterior) wall to mount it on, exactly where the mount-points are, and have already installed two wood screws (2"" long) into the studs. The mirror came with a pre-installed wire, and I'm hoping that these two screws would be stable enough to hold the mirror.</p>

<p>When we tried actually installing the mirror, we tipped it onto one screw, and tried to pivot the rest of the mirror onto the second screw. In the 10 or 15minutes that this process took, I observed the first screw start to tilt downward a little bit. Didn't want to take chances with such a heavy object, and stopped the entire process.</p>

<p>Here's my questions:
01. What specific hook or other fastener can I use to safely hang this mirror?
02. Will just two such fasteners suffice, or should I use more?
03. Should I remove the mirror's wire and use just the D-rings that it came with?
04. If I use #03 above, what method should I use, considering that there aren't any studs close to the D-ring mount points?</p>

"How do I properly seal an exterior door? <p>I've recently discovered that rain is getting in around my exterior (front) door and forming a little pool in the frame under the door.

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Sorry, I realise my question was ambiguous, or even completely ill-phrased. The gap in question is actually the gap between the door itself and the door frame within which it's hung. So there has to be some gap there, but it appears that the gap I have is too large or something and that is allowing rain in a bit (when it comes at a particular angle).

This configuration yields good OTA channels and clarity, but the CCTV is very snowy.  When I installed a Attenuator on the OTA feed (prior to the splitter) it cleaned up the CCTV feed, but have lost 30% of my OTA channels, probably due to the reduced signal input after the Attenuator.

"Would running a new subpanel in parallel meet NEC requirements? If not, what should I do? <h2>Background</h2>

<ul>
<li>U.S.A. Voltages/power present.</li>
<li>My house has a 125A Power Mains breaker at the street.</li>
<li>A buried line runs from the street breaker to my main panel on exterior wall outside of house.</li>
<li>The main panel has 3 220VAC breakers: a 30A, 40A, and 50A.</li>
<li>I have proven the 30A runs to a 3-prong 220VAC Electrical Dryer plug.</li>
<li>I have proven the 50A runs to the existing subpanel in the attached garage which has 11 breakers ranging from 15A to 25A (This panel is full).</li>
<li>I presume the 40A circuit runs to the A/C compressor unit.</li>
<li>The existing subpanel in the garage has two conduits (or knockouts), a small one which contains the power feed from the 50A breaker outside, and a large one which contains the wire bundle that services the fixtures and outlets in the house.</li>
<li>The power feed line in the existing subpanel is wired as follows:
<ul>
<li>L is landed on the L bussbar terminal screw (The bussbar is fully populated with breakers)</li>
<li>N is landed on the N bussbar terminal screw</li>
<li>G is uninsulated, and (oddly) not landed anywhere <strong>I presume this isn't to code</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I need to add a new (additional) subpanel in the garage for additional breakers.</p>

<p>Assuming this is up to code, I intend to parallel the new subpanel with the existing one, by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Properly landing the unlanded G in the existing subpanel</li>
<li>Landing a new L line which will supply the new subpanel on the same bussbar terminal (screw) in the existing subpanel that the existing L line is landed. This new line will run to the subpanel as a power supply line.</li>
<li>Landing a new N line the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I parallel a new subpanel this way, can I route the tie-in to the new subpanel through the larger knockout which contains the wiring to the outlets and fixtures, or must I route the tie-in to the new subpanel through the same small conduit that supplies the existing subpanel?</p>

<p>What parts of this plan are <strong>not up-to-code</strong> (assuming NEC 2008, or 2011)?</p>

"TV mounting with long reach <p>I'm looking to mount my LCD TV (26"" Sony Bravia) in an alcove next to a chimney breast.

<li>master bathroom - Original to 1970s house.    </li>
<li>guest bath - redone this century</li>
<li>associated drain/vent stacks</li>

The leak was not leak, rather just people being wet or splashing in the bathroom. This was not covered by the warranty (different topic), so I got a tube of silicone caulk and sealed the gap and the entire edge of the linoleum floor.</p>

"Gas furnace air is cooler (but NOT COLD) during bitter cold days - why? <p>I have a Lennox central gas furnace. It is only about 3 years old, and was on the very high end of the models available in terms of energy efficiency and such. I sprung for a more expensive model firstly because I got rebates from all my energy companies, and secondly because I actually could afford and wanted to have such efficiency!</p>

<p>Up here in Minnesota we can have some <em>bitterly</em> cold days. It's not uncommon for temps to be well below 0. For example, today the ambient outdoor temperature was minus 5 degrees.</p>

<p>I've noticed that when it gets this cold outside, the heated air coming from the ducts is a lot cooler. It's not cold, there's still very definite warmth to it - this is not an issue with the furnace blowing air without the flame going or anything like that. However, it is certainly nowhere near as warm as it normally is. </p>

<p>When the temps outside are around, say, 30 degrees or even as low as the high teens, the furnace pumps out nice toasty warm air and keeps the house warm running less than 25% of the time. However, once temps drop below 0, the furnace can run 24/7 just to maintain a temperature of 66 degrees! If we get lower than say 10 or 15 below, the furnace basically loses the battle, and will run 24/7 even though the house temp will slowly, slowly, slowly creep downward. Again, the air coming out of the ducts when this happens is significantly cooler, but not cold. Luckily lately we haven't had days that cold in long stretches, but last winter there was a period of maybe a few weeks where the average temps were below 0, and I ended up turning off the water mains and temporarily living with a friend, because it was clear the furnace wasn't going to warm the house back up.</p>

<p>The furnace has two PVC pipes going to the outside - obviously one is an intake and one is an exhaust. The air coming from the exhaust pipe feels <em>a lot</em> warmer than the air coming out of the ducts - however I admit this might be deceptive since it's so bitterly cold outside that anything probably feels warm. </p>

<p>All of the flame systems are working fine. The sensors are good, the ignition goes off without a hitch every time, the burning flame is clearly visible through the observation port, and my gas bill shows that the gas company certainly feels that I'm using a lot of gas. LOL</p>

<p>Any ideas why the air coming out of the system is so much cooler when it's extremely cold outside?</p>

<p>Is this governed by any national (US) or regional codes? Any concerns or code issues with having a flap opening to a garage space instead of a living space (CO, car smells, etc.)?</p>

<p>This would free up some kitchen space by not having to have a separate garbage can in the kitchen. It would save time since that can would not have to be emptied. It could save time sorting garbage if multiple chutes are used for recycling. It should make the kitchen more pleasant as the really stinky garbage would be in the garage and not in the house.</p>

<p>Any general thoughts on this idea? </p>

<p>Any suggestions for alternatives, like maybe an insulated dog door if something like an insulated hatch doesn't exist?</p>

"How to run flexible metal conduit through wall of attached garage? <p>The photo shows a disconnected generator transfer switch and a sub-panel in an interior room on a wall that is shared with an attached garage. </p>

"GFCI breaker tripping to pool pump <p>I have an in ground swimming pool.  There is an outdoor sub panel with a 20amp GFCI breaker is connected to the pump.  Today we had a bad rain storm...water coming down cats and dogs in every direction.</p>

<p>After the storm, I noticed my pool pump wasn't working.  The breaker had tripped.  I tried to turn it on, and it went off immediately.  </p>

<p>So, I swapped out the breaker and the same thing happened....so it's not the breaker.  Tomorrow, I am going to disconnect and wirenut the wires from the pump (disconnect the pump).  If the breaker doesn't trip after that I will conclude there is a short in the wires running through the conduit...right?</p>

<p>Because it will be a pain to pull the wires and replace....which I am ok to run (temporarily, just to make sure it will work) the wires directly from the panel to the pump without putting them in the conduit right away.  When I say ""not right away"" I mean long enough to make sure the breaker doesn't trip.  If it doesn't trip then I would pull all the old wires and snake the new ones through. </p>

"What type of air conditioner to look for <p>I'm looking for a portable air conditioner that can be moved from room to room.  But the key thing I want is one that does not use a condensation tank.  I know they exist because I have seen one.  It diverted the cool side (refrigerant evaporator) condensation to the hot side (refrigerant condensor) and evaporated it into the heat exhaust air flow.  I don't know if it used gravity or a pump to accomplish that.  If the hot side is on the bottom it seems gravity could do this job to get the condensation from the cool fins to the hot fins.</p>

<p>Here's the problem I'm having with this search.  What terminology is used to define this?  I thought it would be ""<strong>evaporative</strong>"".  But I'm seeing ""<strong>evaporative</strong>"" used for something different which requires chilled water to be added to the unit (definitely not what I want).  Apparently it is this type (which I do not want):  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler</a></p>

<p>I searched for ""<strong>tankless</strong>"" but very little matched (and all too large, anyway).</p>

<p>So <strong>what standard term</strong> should be searched for, or asked of sales people, to get to the right type of air conditioner (refrigeration type, with condensation from the cool side fed to the hot side to evaporate through the heat exhaust tube (for portable unit where the tube(s) would go typically out a window)?</p>

<p>The specifications for many of these portable air conditioners list the tank size.  And it looks like some have rather large tanks.  Clearly these are not the ones to get.  But with virtually all retailers regularly omitting many crucial specification on just about everything, I cannot trust the lack of a tank size specification as an indication that it evaporates the condensate.</p>

"What's the right way to sand/shave/reshape particleboard? <p>My second bedroom has low ceilings. I bought an IKEA closet, but somehow botched the measurements when I was seeing if it would fit. So, instead of having ~10cm of room for the top of the cabinet, I have 2-4mm on the high side. I got lucky that they fit at all. :)</p>

<p>However, the ceiling sags a tiny bit, such that one corner of one wall of the closet does not fit between the floor and the ceiling. I'd guess that it's about 2mm too tall. It seems like I should be able to shorten the wall by minimally sanding/shaving/sawing exactly where it strikes the ceiling.</p>

<p>The question is: This cabinet is made of particleboard. It seems like particleboard doesn't cut well, as it's already so soft. What is the correct and safest way to shorten this cabinet without causing structural or aesthetic damage?</p>

"How can I go back to a gas water heater? <p>I recently got a condo unit (low rise condo) on the 4th (top) floor. The unit previously had a gas water heater but was replaced with an electric unit after the gas one broke down I suppose. This was before I got it.</p>

<p>I didn't realize the issues I'd be facing. The electric bills are too high. I thought of going back to gas water heater and asked the heater vendor to do an analysis.

<p>The hot water tank is also used to heat the unit during the winter times, this is what raising the electricity bills.

And the other units in the building are having gas water heater. </p>

"Why do my pipes creak 10 minutes after using them? <p>Our recently installed bathroom uses existing pipes that were previously plumbed into cut out sections of joists, with no cladding.</p>

<p>Approximately 10 minutes after use there is a quite loud creaking. </p>

<p>We were advised this was because of the absence of cladding, and that quick solution is to use expanding foam in between the pipe and timber joist, to act as cladding.  this avoids the much bigger job of completely refitting pipes and pulling up floor/re cutting joists.</p>

"Washing machine randomly tripping GFCI <p>I read a previous question regarding a GFCI outlet and a washing machine, but my issue is slightly different.</p>

<p>I have 2 GFCI outlets in a washroom in the downstairs of my home. One is obviously feeding power to the other, as well as an additional standard outlet (directly) above the washroom in my daughter's nursery.</p>

<p>This was the first time that GFCI had tripped since I bought the home 5 years ago. 
I changed the upstairs outlet, and it worked just fine, when I would plug something in. </p>

"Sealing Off Room Vent Question <p>We put an addition on a couple of years ago.  At that time we installed a second HVAC unit to service the upstairs.  Our original unit still services the basement and main level.  The original contractor only sealed off the vents in 2 of the bedrooms. </p>

<p>The trimmer for both rafters (4) and joists (3) need replacing due to rot.</p>

<p>I can do this myself but would like advice on how alternative ways to best support the rafters during this job.</p>

<p>There is about half a ton of roof and roof tiles to support.</p>

<p>All timbers are 2 x 4 (at approx 14 inch centres): the purlins are 7 x 2. The joists span 13 feet (4 metres), rest on load bearing walls at each end, are tied in to the rafter feet, and are stiffened by binders which run across, again on structural walls. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: doubling up is not an option because there is no structural wall for the new rafters/joists to sit on (because they are trimmed around the stack).

One option that came to mind was running new joists (say 9 x 2) parallel with the existing and building a frame of these with vertical struts nailed to the rafters from underneath. The binders that run at right angles would have to be temporarily cut through and perhaps supported off the new joists. I accept that structural calculations would be ideal, but at present the weight of the trimmed rafters and the ceiling joists is taken by two 4 x 2 x 13 feet joists and it has stayed sound (no sagging) for 70 years.

<p>I asked a few friends (one contractor builder, the rest just amateur DIY'ers like me) about the best way to lay it, and they all said to install it as a ""floating"" floor. So I went out and bought a load of fixing clips, and as I went along, I put one clip about every 3 foot from each other between each strip of flooring.</p>

<p>Now I'm not so sure if that was needed, as I was laying it onto existing floorboards. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's the fixing clips which are causing the floor to creak, but I don't think I'm going to be able to lift it all up (without damaging it all), as the clips are holding it all together pretty tight. Any ideas on how I can stop the creaking?</p>

"How to temporarily connect inverter-generator safely to mains panel <p>I don't have one of these gasoline powered inverters yet, but am considering getting a portable 2200 watt to power lights, fridge/freezer.

"Replace ""powered"" dimmer switch for old (1950s) house <p>We have an old dimmer switch, single pole, the type with an indicator light internally. It has two black wires, and the green wire is cut off.  The plastic box it's connected to has only two wires, one black, one white.  They are obviously 120 volts, since the switch has a light in it, and I measured it with a circuit tester.  It seems to be described as ""electro-mechanical"".  The part is a Leviton catalog No. 6631, but the instructions I see for these seem to be different than this device, and show the conventional hookup with 2 pairs of wires.</p>

I think I might need to rewire if I want anything other than a crappy dimmer; I can't even use a simple switch, because as soon as I turn it on, it might be a short from hot to neutral black to white). </p>

"How can I locate and deal with mold between floors? <p>About 9 months ago, my wife and I replaced a toilet that had a broken wax ring.  We got some water leaking down to the ceiling on the first floor.  Now I'm having what seem to be mold symptoms -- I get runny eyes, have trouble breathing, and feel nauseous when I go into the bathroom.  (I'm pretty sensitive to mold; my wife feels nothing).  </p>

<p>I think that we probably have mold growing from the original leak, so I've opened a small hold in the celing underneath.  What I see through the grate are some planks.  They look like they were soaked through at one point but aren't wet right now.  I'll try to get a picture and post it later.  I don't see any mold at this point.</p>

<p>Anyone have any tips on how to procede?  It's just a small hole right now, should I widen it?  Should I cut through the mesh to get a better look?  I'm going to hire someone to put the ceiling back on (time constraint).  I assume it'll be a lot more expensive if they have to deal the mesh  as well?</p>

<p>Any easy ways to tell if there's still some kind of leak going on?  Any advise greatly appreciated!  I do have a professional coming out, but he can't get here until next Wednesday and I'd like to resolve as much as I can quickly.</p>

<p>Here's an update:</p>

<p>I think I'm seeing some black wood in there (need a better flashlight!). </p>

<p>Assuming I am, I guess my questions change to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it o.k. to kill the mold by blasting ozone through a hole in the ceiling?  I know this is generally not the recommended way to clean up mold; but I would do it by blasting for a limited time with no one in the house.  I don't think there's anything between the floors I would need to worry about damaging?</li>
<li>I need to figure out if there's still a leak or some kind of humidity problem.  Is it safe to assume that because the problem got worse there is?  Should I try to find the pipes and see if they're leaking?</li>
<li>I would still like to hire someone to fix the plaster ceiling.  Is it going to cost a huge amount extra if I cut through the mesh and they have to replace some of it?  Does area make a massive difference in price for that kind of job?  For what it's worth, I'm fine having drywall put up instead of plaster.</li>

"Do I have to worry about condensation on plywood over rigid foam insulation in the attic? <p>I have a vented attic space with poor insulation in the attic floor and rafters, so I'm going to button it up.  </p>

<p>My energy auditor suggested I insulate the floor as follows: cut blocks of rigid foam for the ends of the joist bays, and tack them in place with spray foam.  Then, fill the joist bays with loose cellulose, and top that with rigid foam (ISO) seam-sealed with spray foam.   This should create the air and vapor barrier between the conditioned and unconditioned spaces.  Finally, since I'd want to use it as storage space, I'd put plywood or OSB decking over the top.  </p>

<p>The rafters will be fiberglass bats (there are some in place that were improperly installed, but in good shape, so I want to reuse them) with the foil side facing towards the roof about 1"" off the sheathing.  I'll then staple FSK across the rafters with the foil facing in.</p>

<p>I think I'm on board with everything, but I'm wondering about the decking and the FSK.

"What exactly is a PAR type LED lamp, how does it differ from R/BR type LED & CFL lamps? <p>I am in the process of replacing my incandescent bulbs with more efficient alternatives. My home is about 14 years old, I've owned it for a little over three years. It seems most of the bulbs that it ""came with"" are original, and since I purchased the house almost every tungsten bulb in a built-in fixture ended up burning out. In particular were the R40 ceiling floods, of which I have 16 in total in the interior. I'd ignored many of them, as I rarely turned most of them on, however when three in my kitchen burned out within a weeks period, I up and replaced the whole lot with EcoSmart (made by Lighting Science) R30 CFL's that offer around 800 lumens.</p>

<p>The initial difference was HUGE. The 14 year old bulbs were extremely dim and VERY orange in color. The CFLs, when fully warmed up, are very nice and bright. I chose cooler colors (3500k and 5000k) which light the place much more naturally (at least to my eyes). The caveat with CFL, as I am learning, is they do not perform well in cooler temperatures. I try to use my heater as little as possible in the winter, generally only heating when the interior temperature drops below 60-64 degrees. All of the CFL R30s I purchased have a common problem, which seems to be common across brands as I've tried TCP, Phillips, and others: Very long warmup time, very low lumens during warmup, and an extreme magenta hue during warmup. The bulbs also do not seem to reach full brightness, and the way the reflectors are designed, the shape of the spiral inside the R30 ""can"" is clearly visible and appears rather dark.</p>

<p>I've decided to switch to LED, despite the cost. In trying out a few from the local store, they seem far superior to CFL. They start instantly, always produce the same color, are fully dimmable (and seem to dim smoothly unlike CFL), and don't seem to be affected by temperature. I've only ever used R or BR type, however all of the ones at the local store in the color temperatures I prefer are PAR type. The BR type LED floods seem to produce similar quality and diffused light to the CFL's, but the only color I can find are 2700K. What exactly is the difference between an R/BR type flood and a PAR type flood? Additionally, what are the differences between PAR30, PAR38, etc? Are PAR type good for indoor use (in the past, I'd only ever seen a few mentions that PAR type were required for outdoor scenarios, indicating they were better sealed against weather)?</p>

"Will canola oil have any adverse effects on silicone? <p>So I needed to fill in a rather slab like shape with silicone.

I didn't like it so I put on a glove and tried to smooth it out but it just stuck to the glove like crazy. </p>

If it takes longer to cure.. whatever. </p>

<p>What I don't want though is fractures in the silicone mass caused by the oil separating it. Due to the way I was shaping it, this might be the case if canola is effective at preventing it from bonding with itself. Would that be the case?</p>

"How should I protect the metal of a power rack that's kept outdoors? <p>I plan on building a power rack for my home gym and was wondering what kind of metal/coating I should use when building it since it will be stored outdoors. Most commercial power racks are built using mild steel and are coated with paint to protect it from rust. These racks should last when used indoors but I'm not so sure if it will when it is kept outdoors. </p>

<p>If I were to build my power rack from mild steel, how should I go about protecting it from rusting? While the rack will stay outdoors, it will be situated under some kind of shade/tent similar to this:</p>

<p>The power rack will stand over concrete or plywood (over concrete), not grass/soil.</p>

<p>With these details in mind, can anyone suggest how I should treat/coat the mild steel? I've taught of powder coating it but again, I'm not sure how that would hold up. How about chroming? Is it too expensive/overkill? </p>

<p>How about using something similar to the following:</p>

<p>These are pictures of my old bench. Since the bench is still standing strong after so many years, I take something like its material would be appropriate for my use case. What do you call this kind of metal/coating, anyway? What properties does it have and is it difficult or expensive to produce/replicate? </p>

<p>Please provide details as to why I should prefer each method over the other. If you would prefer to use some other kind of metal(stainless steel, galvanized steel, aluminum etc), please state why. I tried Google-ing the pros and cons of each method of coating I stated above but I'm still unable to reason out to myself which one to use. If all of them would equally serve the purpose, I guess it will all boil down to which one is the most cost-effective to produce.</p>

"How to solve new condensation in bathroom exhaust fan ducts? <p>We live in New Orleans in a two story, 95 year old stucco house.  When we renovated 10 years ago, we put over 30 recessed can lights in the upstairs ceiling.  Those openings in an older leaky house&mdash;coupled with a poorly insulated attic&mdash;caused us to have terrible condensation problems upstairs in the hot humid months between May and October.</p>

<p>Every ceiling opening had moisture and mildew.  Our smoke alarms filled with water, and our hallway walls and ceiling would drip water in the early morning.</p>

<p>It took us some time (and the input of some smart people) to figure out the issue, but in the last year we have made several changes: our HVAC system has been completely redesigned and we made the decision to spray foam the attic (a fairly new option for Gulf coast states).  Our condensation problems have been resolved and we have a comfortable, dry house.  Going from consistent 65-75% relative humidity in the summer to the low 50s&mdash;which is low for New Orleans!  The attic is now pleasant as well, just a few degrees warmer than the house.</p>

<p>Just as we were ready to move back in, we discovered both bathroom fan exhaust ducts, as well as the gas dryer duct&mdash;all upstairs&mdash;have been filling with condensation.  (The exhaust vent in the powder room downstairs is fine.)  This is a new thing.</p>

<p>The guest bathroom duct and the dryer duct (both about 3-5' runs) travel horizontally and exhaust out the side of the house. The bath goes through the attic, the dryer through an inside closet.  The master bath exhausts go upward diagonally through the attic to the roof about 5-7'.  We then installed an additional damper within each bathroom duct (in addition to the damper that is part of the fan unit) and insulated the ducts.  The problem reduced somewhat (the bathroom ceiling no longer has condensation around the grill), but when the fans are turned on, water comes pouring out.</p>

<p>We have talked to a few HVAC companies and mechanical engineers and all acknowledge they are seeing more of this recently and are not sure what is causing it, nor how to solve it beyond what we have already done.  We definitely have a tighter, drier house.  But we have not really been able to achieve positive pressure.  Not without spray foaming the crawlspace under the house, an option with a lot of potential problems for us.</p>

<p>Our HVAC company thinks the bathrooms could exhaust into the HVAC system or even the attic itself without problems, but given our history with moisture issues, I am leery.  Another idea has been to install an electrically controlled damper that works in sync with the exhaust fan and is not dependent on the air flow. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

"Maintainability of natural stone vs porcelain floor tile? <p>I am planning a kitchen floor retile project, I'm initially researching tile selection.  I was comparing two tiles and someone at a big box retailer told me that while marble tiles look nicer, they have the disadvantage of being more difficult to maintain.</p>

"Underground Wires + Bare Ground Condutor, entering building <p>I had a  setup in which underground aluminum wire coming from a garage (detached structure) travels through a  ¾ pvc conduit into what seems to be a rather shallow depth trench.

Initially, I simply put an adapter/fitting in order to  transition to 1” pvc conduit, but was told that would not be acceptable (it is not clear why though) to simply use an adapter and that I would have to use an electrical box (in this case a L box) to transition.

"NM cable next to hot water pipe <p><strong>Edit:</strong> The answer below indicates that at least in some places inspectors consider it inacceptable to attach any wiring to pipes. However, I would still like to understand <em>why</em> it is a bad idea.</p>

After the contractor left, I noticed that they ran two 12/2 NM cables from the boiler to the two pumps along the hot water pipe, attaching the cables to the pipe with plastic cable ties. I am concerned about the exposure of cables to the heat.</p>

<p>According to my reading of 110.11 of NEC, it appears to be disallowed. On the other hand, according to the formula in 310.15(B)(2), using temperature of 180F it appears to be OK with a margin to spare. The 310.15(B)(3) does not apply since there are only two cables run together.</p>

"Mounting a 32"" LED TV to Dry Wall without Stud Support <p>We're looking into mounting our current TV on the wall in the bedroom, however we've hit a minor snag, it appears there's no stud in the area where the TV would be mounted.</p>

<p>I've searched the wall using the 'magnet trick' and positioned the TV where we'd like it to go (opposite the bed) and it falls exactly between the edge of the wall (metal stud) and the wooden stud which is half way down the wall.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0012S4APK"" rel=""nofollow"">mount that I'm looking at</a> (and that's pictured) includes two snap toggle bolts, and I've also looked into and found some additional spring toggles. The TV itself is quite light weighing only 11.0 lb or 5 kg.</p>

<p>Anyway, what all the preamble boils down to is, do you think it'll be safe to mount the TV directly to the dry wall using a combination of Spring Toggles and Snap Toggles and not mounting it to a stud? If so, do you have any tips or hints on how to do it safely? If not, do you have any other suggestions?</p>

"Creating 1"" Air Gap between foundation wall and fiberglass batts <p>We just bought a house in Calgary, AB, Canada and noticed that the basement is below grade and is insulated with fiberglass batts. There is no drywall at the moment; hence, I have access to the vapor barrier and the fiberglass batts.</p>

<p>The house is 10 years old and the basement walls look dry. I noticed that there is no air gap between the foundation wall and the fiberglass batt. Basically, the fiberglass batt is touching the foundation wall and the framing studs are 2x4. I was thinking of putting a 1x6 treated wood fence board per cavity box to distance the fiberglass batt from the foundation wall. This is not the best solution but I believe it may be the cheapest and quickest. So, one side of the 1x6 treated wood would be touching the foundation wall and the other side will be touching the fiberglass batt. I am hoping that the thickness of the fence board will create the approximately 1"" air gap, see attached picture. </p>

"Door replacement - will door still be solid after cutting? <p>I need to replace/repair a door in my rented apartment.  During a rather rowdy party one of my guests managed to put a hole in my bathroom door.  </p>

<p>I don't think that there is probably anyway to repair the door cleanly.  (If you look carefully I drilled a whole in the broken in piece and tried to pull it back out).  I think that the easiest solution is going to be replacing the door.  (Please let me know if there are any suggestions).  </p>

"Sump pit filling very quickly from inlet pipes <p>In October, I bought a large home with a sump pit in the basement. The previous owners had a sump pump but left it shut off (unplugged). I bought the house three months before moving in, so the pump had been disabled for at least that long. The pit was filled with water up to the top of the three inlet pipes and there's no evidence that water ever went above that level.</p>

<p>I thought it odd that the pump was installed, but disabled. So I turned it on and it works. But the pit re-fills to the level of the float switch within 90 seconds! I figured I would just leave it and see if the incoming flow of water would decrease, but it has been four months now and the inflow of water has been the same regardless of weather conditions outside. See picture to get an idea of how fast it fills.</p>

<p>I tried to figure out where the water drains to. It flows through a pipe to the exterior of the house and then turns 90 degrees straight down into the ground. Where it leads from there... I have no idea. This elbow joint occurs underneath our patio, so without tearing the whole patio out and then digging, I don't see any way to figure out where the pipe leads. We do not have city sewer, and I am sure it does not feed into the septic tank (I checked).</p>

<p>Should I be concerned? Should I just disable the pump and let the pit fill up until it stops and just leave it like that? It never seems to overflow and there's no evidence of water ever flooding into the basement. Any tips for how we might figure out where the water is draining to? </p>

"Any US building codes about a door opening into a hallway near a stairway? <p>A while ago I changed a door out from my tiny bathroom so that it opens outside of the bathroom and into the hallway.  It looks attractive and provides a great deal more room in the bathroom making it feel much bigger now.  It was also a great deal of work since I reused the existing door frame, chiseled new hinge slots and used wood putty to cover up the old hinge slots in the existing door frame.</p>

<p>Now that we are going to sell the house, a friend of mine mentioned that perhaps the house was purposely built for the door to swing inside the bathroom because the door is close to the stairway and that it could be some kind of building code.  The house was built in 1958 so if it were a code decision so long ago then I am sure somebody might know something about this.  My father in law is pretty handy but has never heard of such a building code.</p>

<p>I am terrified now that this might get called out in a home inspection and that if it were a code issue that I will be required to replace the door before I can sell the house.  Is this indeed a code issue in the United States?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I included a rough diagram so that you can visualize this:</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>I realize that information this localized is not on topic for this forum, but I am a resident of Pennsylvania and according to the local building codes that user Sean Cheshire was so kind to give me (Thank you!), this was the only building codes in regards to stair landings that I could find:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R311.5.4 Landings for stairways. There shall be a floor or
  landing at the top and bottom of each stairway.
  Exception: Afloor or landing is not required at the top of
  an interior flight of stairs, including stairs in an enclosed I
  garage, provided a door does not swing over the stairs.
  A flight of stairs shall not have a vertical rise larger than
  12 feet (3658 mm) between floor levels or landings.
  The width of each landing shall not be less than the width
  of the stairway served. Every landing shall have a minimum
  dimension of36 inches (914 mm) measured in the direction
  of travel.</p>

<p>It doesn't appear like the door swings over the stairway so I should be okay!  Thanks everyone!</p>

"220 hot tub / spa breaker question <p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QB5Lu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/QB5Lu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>Ok......  I had an older spa pump that went out.  I also replaced the spa pack. The old spa pack had a GFCI breaker in it and the new one does not.  So now I have to add gfci protection to the spa via a gfci breaker.  The older main panel (square D) does not make gfci breakers for that style of panel (1980's).  So I elminated the hot tub from the main and moved it into an under utilized already existing sub panel.</p>

<p>Here is where I am now lost..... the sub has only one bus bar, all wired attached are grounds, there is NO floating neutral bus bar. I know I can NOT run the breaker (which has a built in ""coiled"" neutral wire to the ground bus bar or I create a parallel circuit which will feed back current and will not trip the gfci.</p>

<p>So.......
Question 1:  Can I ground the hot tub in the subpanel and run the neutral into the main panel and attach it there ?  Will that create a parallel circuit?  Will that prevent the gfci breaker from tripping?</p>

<p>Question 2:  If that will not work....... OPTION A: is there a way to ground the subpanel, (grounding rod) and mount a new bus bar to ground box and use the other bus bar as a neutral bar.  OR OPTION B: how do I create a neutral bus bar in the subpanel...... (if this is the option I need details) I know it needs to float, but where would it connect to in the main panel ? What gauge wire would be needed?</p>

<p>More info..... the main panel does not have a Main disconnect breaker, the sub panel is being fed from a 60 AMP breaker in the main panel that has two wires from the breaker to the subpanel lugs, a ground and a neutral in the main panel.
The current subpanel (also Square D) bus is a ground bus running to the main panel bus.</p>

"How to indentify if the crack on plastered brickwalls is cosmetic or structural? <p>First up, I understand these kind of things are best left to experts' inspection and internet forums won't help much. I have called an engineer but until he arrives in a day or two, for my solace, I am asking this question. FYI I am just short of having a panic attack!</p>

<p><strong>About the house</strong></p>

<p>Ours is a three storeyed house about 35 years old. It is a brick wall and concrete plastered house all the way, typical of India, and has 11 columns in all. Till 2011 there was a small room on the third floor and the rest was terrace. In 2011 the room was extended incorporating the entire terrace. Before the extension we had contacted an engineer and he inspected the house and gave a go ahead. The problem is in this new floor.</p>

<p><strong>About the cracks</strong></p>

<p>Lately, possibly from the beginning of this year, I have noticed hairline cracks on all the walls. Most of them are thin and vertical. They don't go all the way. Some start at the top near the ceiling and stop midway. Some start midway and stop midway. None go all the way to the bottom to the floor, and none rise from there. Only two cracks have a vaguely diagonal shape but they don't continue all the way and stop midway. All the cracks stop abruptly. Although the cracks don't seem to be mirroring on both sides of the wall, they are present in some places (not all) and close to mirroring.</p>

<p>The cracks don't seem to be widening but I get to see more cracks the more I look. I am not sure if they were always there or are they developing newly. I am very scared TBH. The reason I am panicking is I have absolutely no clue about the seriousness. My father thinks they are just air cracks on the plaster. We had called the contractor (not the engineer) a couple of months back and he said the same. </p>

"Precautions in connecting high voltage source to a relay? <p>I want to use the following relay to control a 220V AC electrical device.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/n211N.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/n211N.jpg"" alt=""USB Relay""></a></p>

<p>The device may be an oven or a heating plate which I think should draw a less than 10A current (but the current should still be quite large).</p>

<p>I think I should cut the ""live"" wire of the electrical device and insert the 2 cut wire parts into the relay, while the ""neutral"" wire should be left unchanged. And then enclose the relay with a plastic box to protect it from touch by anyone.</p>

<p>As I have only some experience with small current electronics but have no experience in handling large current devices. I want to know that should I use ""Heat-shrink tube"" when connecting the cut ""live"" wires into the relay pins ? If yes, which type/model of ""Heat-shrink tube"" should I use for an enough protection ?</p>

<p>Moreover, is there any online tutorial/example for connecting large current device to a relay in a safe manner ?</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestion.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> </p>

<p>After some googling, I find that there are two youtube videos that show the use of this kind of SONGLE relay to switch some 120V AC light blubs. They are located <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt6ZKP9XEBM"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjBRScRAVrc"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this kind of relay seems do well on short term high voltage/current AC switching, safety concerns (e.g. overheat, etc) about its long term usage are still under question.</p>

"How do I make professional grade double pane glass at home? <p>I've been shopping around and no one near me will do Argon filled double pane and only one place will do a vacuum. The price seemed astronomically high considering I can buy the glass and the local hardware store (single pane 2x amount to make double pane) for ~1/10 of the cost. So ranting aside, what is the best way to make double pane glass / window inserts from single pane glass? 
I was thinking about using something easy like a few 1/4"" plastic tile spacers to keep a uniform spacing with weight or light clamp then applying heavy silicone bead to everywhere but the spacers, coming back later to fill in all but one or two of the spacer holes. Do a good inspection and cleaning if necessary, plug to have one hole left and then pulling a vacuum to ~7-10psi (~5 psi vacuum from ambient). Last hole (vacuum hole) will have to be plugged/corked with something else then silicone to ensure longevity. </p>

<p>My project calls for 24 ~8.5""x11"" inserts, trying to weigh in my approx. time to build these and that I already have vacuum pump, I could have a 50% success rate and still save money so if it at all possible to do this at home/shop I'm going with that option.</p>

"How can I build a fence next to existing neighboring fences? <p>I would like to fence in my back yard.  Nothing super fancy, just a black metal fence like you see everywhere.  I got some quotes from some contractors and they wanted $6k+ (!!) to build the fence.

<p>How hard would this be to do myself? I don't want/need to run a fence along the sides, so how would I go about integrating with my neighbor's fences?

"How can I paint/stain an interior concrete floor? <p>I have a very lovable aging bulldog who has peed on the wall-to-wall carpet enough that I'm ripping it out. It's over twenty years old anyway.</p>

<p>The subfloor is a concrete slab. My goal is to make the concrete livable. Goals in order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Urine-proof (waterproof). A puddle may sit for five hours before I get home to clean it up. Ideally a bit of soap and water, and no trace is left behind. None.</p></li>
<li><p>Low VOC products. I've got severe allergies to many/most chemicals. These rooms are my primary living space. I'll test whatever I plan to use, but I need to be very careful so as not to make the place uninhabitable for me. I'm disabled, and am in the main room probably twenty hours a day.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy application. Fewer products, fewer applications is better, though it's not the primary deciding factor.</p></li>
<li><p>Something attractive. Least important, but I'm thinking more mottled see-thru stain than I am glossy garage floor. Probably a medium brownish color.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I found some Behr products at Home Depot, but received conflicting information. At this point I'd consider <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/100200359?productId=100200359"" rel=""nofollow"">Behr Solid Color Concrete Stain</a>, or <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-Premium-1-Gal-902-Slate-Gray-1-Part-Epoxy-Concrete-and-Garage-Floor-Paint-90201/100113293"" rel=""nofollow"">Behr 1-Part Epoxy Concrete &amp; Garage Floor Paint</a>.</p>

<p>The Home Depot employee giving me advice said I don't need to prime either product. Just apply to bare concrete. Said either product would satisfy the waterproof requirement.</p>

<p>However, the specs on the products contradict that guidance. Both say ""primer required"". The stain is ""waterproof"", the paint is not. Neither product is a ""sealer"". I'd have thought one of the goals was to seal the porous nature of the floor, at least a 1/2"" down, no?</p>

<p>I am looking at priming with Seal-Krete Lock-Down Epoxy Bonding Floor Primer (sorry, I don't have enough reputation to post the link). A big plus for me is that it's the only product thus far with a Low VOC rating. If I understand it, this will seal the pores, and allow the paint/stain to bond properly. It's amber-clear, so it seems that would work under brown-tinted stain, even if the stain isn't completely opaque.</p>

<p>Does this sound like a good plan? Prime with the Seal-Krete, and follow with the Solid Stain?</p>

<p>Initially I wanted a transparent stain, to see the mottling of the concrete. But I had to prime. Since I'm probably priming anyway, would Behr Semi-Transparent Concrete Stain work? My concern is if the urine will puddle, or seep in? The product is not waterproof.</p>

"How do I ground my LED retrofit in a ceiling can? <p>I've got what appears to be a low height 5"" can above the kitchen sink.  There is a 60W IC bulb in there.

<p>It looks like it's going to be a very tight squeeze, but <em>should</em> barely fit.  My issue though is that the LED kit says it must be grounded to the can.  They list 3 methods:</p>

<li><p>Attach supplied ground with supplied screw to existing ground hole in can. </p>

<p>There is a hole in the can, but it's MUCH bigger around than the supplied screw and it's not anywhere deep enough for the supplied screw either.  In addition, it's so low in the can that I don't know that the assembly will even go into place with a screwhead there.  Presumably it was designed for a safety wire to be attached there to keep a cover from falling to the ground and shattering.  Probably not a good idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Attach supplied ground to one of the can height adjustment screws.  </p>

"Completing a prior subpanel install <p>I recently bought a home built in 2007. I had the chance to meet with the original homeowner who shown me some of the things that were on his list to finish before he sold the house but never got the chance. One of the things was the completion of a 100 amp subpanel in an outbuilding I will use as a shop. Eventually I will add another 40 amp subpanel that will come off the 100 amp subpanel in the shop, to go to a nearby barn in the future.</p>

<p>What he has set up already is a 100 amp  double pole circuit breaker in the main panel. I had no idea where it terminated at until he shown me a J box on the back of the house, which it was not tied into yet, but it was in the wall. It just needed to be brought out, so I did. I tested it to make sure the breaker operated that cable. All good so far.</p>

<p>The shop has a wire ran in ground that can handle the load also. It was coiled in the crawlspace, so I brought it out through the wall. The pic I have below is the pair I brought out.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yqSWQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
What I am looking for in the picture is what type of weatherproof low profile box is out there that I can use to tie these into, preferably not using ""bugs"" that will take a ton of tape and what ever else is used to keep the cables from shorting out.</p>

<p>The cable from the breaker is going to enter the Jbox from the top, the one feeding the shop is going to exit out of the bottom.</p>

<p>Maybe it is expecting too much, but if there is a box that will recess into a 2X6 wall and leave room for insulation behind it and had enough cubic inches to handle the cable with out sticking out too far would be pretty cool. I imagine if there is such a thing, knowing the name of the Jbox would prove handy. I really want to stay away from a trough.</p>

<p>The next pic is of the subpanel itself. It has 3 lugs. I am figuring with the right name and a hopeful edit of my pic, that the ground wire can be sorted out too.

I figure, but I would like confirmation, that the new lug for the ground can be screwed or bolted to the back of the box and tie it in there.

"Rheem Heat Pump A/C Mode Delay Cycle In Hot Weather <p>I have a Rheem 15PJL48A01 heat pump which has been working correctly for years, and is maintained properly. It is hot here currently and so it is operating in cooling mode.</p>

<p>Yesterday and today, it has been very hot out. 105 &deg;F yesterday and 103 &deg;F today. The outdoor pump's fan has been cutting off every 20 minutes or so during the day.

There is power to the heat pump outdoor unit at all times. I removed the panel to investigate the shutdown code and it codes ""5 min delay"" and no other issue. <strong>Interestingly,</strong> at night when the ambient temperature cools off, the fan will run for hours without issue, blowing cold air through the home until the desired temperature is reached.</p>

"Installing Ceiling Fan, Weird Double Switch Install <p>EDIT: Nevermind, I figured it out.  I just rewired the switches to that one isn't even connected and the other is connected properly and it works great.</p>

<p>My house was built back in the 70's and has had some renovations but we are new owners.  I am trying to replace the ceiling fan (something I have done multiple times previously with no issues) but I hit a bit of a snag due to the dual switch.  In this room there is a switch for the fan and another for the light.  The fan I am installing only has black, white, and ground wires because it is controlled via a remote control.  In the ceiling, there are only three wires, white, black, and ground.  Apparently these are not functioning as I would imagine due to the dual switch since when I installed things normally (white to white, black to black, green to ground) nothing happened.</p>

<p>I tried installing just a basic light that I have that only has white and black wires to diagnose the issue and finally I got it to turn on when I put the white to white and black to the ground.  This makes me guess whoever wired the switches did so in a way that the ground wire is essentially being used as a neutral which I imagine is not the proper way to do things. Since I have no need for a dual switch I assume it would be best to just go back to a single but this is about the extent of my electrician knowledge and it isn't something I want to just guess with.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures of the switches, I will explain everything that is happening with the wires below but sometimes a picture is a lot better.</p>

<p>[![][1]][1]<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHB8J.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHB8J.jpg"" alt=""""></a><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mG6tS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mG6tS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So the three wires coming from the ceiling are coming in on the right side.  The black ceiling wire is going to the top right spot on the right switch.  The white ceiling wire is going to the top right spot on the left switch.  The ceiling ground is connected to two white wires going behind the left switch (goes to a spot where one says + and the other says N).</p>

<p>The bottom right spots on both switches are connected by a small black wire.  On the bottom right spot of the right switch there is another black wire going to two other black wires and a red one that go behind the left switch same as the two white wires that accompany the ground from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Can I install the fan as is or is that a bad situation?  Is the best solution to just get rid of one switch and convert things to how it should be setup with one switch in the first place?  If so how would I correct the wiring?</p>

When I went to bust up the drywall to see whats behind it I found out it's been there since the house was built in the 80s (construction adhesive I've seen before).  I have NO IDEA why this would be done this way and was hoping someone could explain. Here's what I'm working with.</p>

<p>looking toward the front ... (drywall is sloped from stairs heading to front door) hmmmmmm why a 2x6?

<p>To the right is cinder block, to the left is the garage (2x4s and drywall), in front of this is the entry way (front of the house).  I'm pretty sure I can't remove this, or if I wanted to, I would have to support the front steps that stick out about 5 feet before a deck starts.  Is there any way I can reclaim this space and safely support the front steps?  I prefer to do things overkill so if there's an option, I'd love to hear it!  The steps out front are 4' off the ground, roughly.</p>

"What is this burnt cement floor treatment called? <p>In Brazil we have a floor finish named Burnt Cement (that doesn't involve burning). Here is a <a href=""http://www.poxadrez.com.br/nc/applications/po-xadrez/burnt-cement/"" rel=""nofollow"">description of the process</a></p>

<p>In summary, you use a mix of cement and pigment (sometimes marble powder too) sprinkled over fresh concrete floor (1 part cement and 3 parts sand), and then use a steel float to spread it. It can simply color, or have a stained effect.</p>

If that is correct, I need to find some instructions on how to execute this (a video showing the effect would be even better).</p>

"Is it ever a good strategy to not select a seat when you are in unassigned status on American Airlines? <p>So here's my not-so-hypothetical situation. My wife and I are on an American Airlines flight and for the longest leg (~6 hours) there are only ""Premium"" economy seats and crappy (single middle) seats left.</p>

<p>I just got changed to this flight because of a night-before cancellation, so I didn't even have a chance to pick a good seat from the free options despite booking this trip 2 months prior to departure.</p>

<p>So here's my theory that I'm trying to validate/invalidate. If I don't pick a seat and let them assign it at the gate, it seems like the odds improve to get a ""Premium economy"" seat. My reasoning is that if I just pick a crappy middle seat from the remaining free options, that's exactly what I'll get. However, I'm betting that they hold back premium seats hoping to get people to pay for them at the last minute, and they are more likely to be open for people without assignments on a full flight.</p>

<p>Another factor is that my wife and I bought our tickets together, I don't how hard they try to keep people who are flying together (at least couples) seated next to each other, but if they do it would reduce the odds of us getting assigned a single middle seat. </p>

<p>Any insiders with American have thoughts on my theory and whether it increases my odds by not preselecting a seat assignment? Do they give any weight seating couples together on a flight?</p>

"Help remembering name of  hotel in near Łódź, Poland? <p>This summer I was in Poland. We drove around by car and visited several small villages. I some help to remember the name of the village and the hotel we stayed in. </p>

<p>I have only some very vague hints:</p>

<p>The village is very near to Lodz. We arrived late in the evening and in Łódź we couldn't find an accommodation. Every hotel, hostel, campsite etc. was full. So we left Łódź in the direction of Oświęcim (Auschwitz). We drove on the highway only a very short time. Then we turned right and arrived in a very small village. But nevertheless it was a relatively luxurious hotel that had a big park and looked relatively new. This hotel is run by a father and son. We didn't stay in this hotel but in another one that was in the next street. The owner of the first hotel recommend this one.</p>

<p>Our hotel was very cheap and had a private parking space. It was necessary to get a key from the reception to open the gate to the parking lot. Almost opponent to this hotel there is a very small store that sells some food. Neither the hotel personal nor the shop owner speaks English.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening and we hadn't anything to eat. So we drove back on the highway and turned in the direction to Oświęcim. After 2 or 3 minutes we saw a restaurant directly at the highway in form of a mill.</p>

<p>That's all I can remember. I would be very happy if someone can identify the village and the hotel.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, <a href=""http://forums.redflagdeals.com/battery-bank-mah-limit-carry-airplane-1520701/"" rel=""nofollow"">someone asked my exact question about my exact brand of battery at some forum</a>. Unfortunately, in a perfect example of why forums are terrible, instead of answering the question, they just started arguing about whether the asker even needed a battery (trust me, I do), whether it's standard to have power sockets on airlines these days (trust me, where I'm flying, it isn't), and recommending solar charging (that's already how I charge this battery!).</p>

"What chemical / solution / reagent are TSA agents using when they test liquids? <p>I was reading a news article that apparently TSA agents in the US have been randomly swabbing liquids including drinks, even purchased in the airport beyond the existing screening.</p>

"How to keep track of all things you are carrying in the luggage and where they are? <p>Often when packing for a trip, I start in a very good manner and following the <a href=""http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/3493/6997"">best techiniques available</a>.</p>

<p>Once I am kind of done with the basics, I start noticing little things that are missing: my agenda, the battery charger, the set of keys, that extra pair of socks that may be useful at the end, etc.</p>

<p>When it is time to unpack or use any of the items, the problem starts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I put the agenda next to the shoes or, instead, in the little pocket of the bag?</li>
<li>Weren't the socks just underneath the umbrella?</li>

"About Different Types of Visas For ""Business"" vs ""Work"" In the U.S.? <p>Maybe I'm using the wrong terms, but I'll try to explain the differences between what I call a ""business"" visa, and a ""working"" visa to make my question clear. </p>

<p>A friend of mine is a securities (stock and bond) analyst in the U.K. He wants to come to the U.S. to research a company, call it IBM, that his U.K.-based firm is thinking of investing in. Here he'd meet with executives of IBM, visit a few plants, ask some questions, etc. After he was finished with the American ""leg"" of the process,he'd go back to the U.K., write up his report, and make his recommendation to his U.K. employer, who pays him there. I assume my friend would need what I call a ""business"" visa to come to the U.S. for this purpose.</p>

<p>Contrast this with a U.K. citizen who has accepted a job offer from IBM to work in the U.S., and he'll be paid here by the U.S. employer. I would imagine that he would need to go through a much more stringent process to get what I call a ""work"" visa, which IBM would probably help him get.</p>

"Compensation for denied boarding due to baggage delay <p>Recently, my son and I traveled from Bangkok to the US, and when boarding our connecting flight in Hong Kong we were involuntarily denied boarding because the airline could not locate my son's checked-in bag.<br>
Long story short, the airline lost his bag then kicked us off our flight because of their mistake! </p>

<p>I am aware that airlines cannot transport baggage without the passenger, in the event that a passenger fails to show for the flight their bags are checked in on. But in this case, we presented our valid boarding passes showing that our bags were checked through from BKK to the US.<br>
The airlines had 100% control of our bags and we could not have had anything to do with the missing bag. We arrived at our destination 11 hours late as a result.  </p>

<p>When I complained and asked for compensation, they claimed that they fulfilled their obligation by paying for an alternate flight.<br>
They admitted that the situation was mishandled and offered us $50 gift cards. </p>

<p>But they acted as though we were crazy for requesting the involuntary denial of boarding compensation that would have applied if we had been bumped due to the flight being oversold (which was also the case since it was a full flight and our seats were given to standby passengers). I have reached an impasse with the airline. </p>

<p>Additional details from the comments:
I purchased R/T tickets SEA-BKK and all flights were Delta except BKK-HKG on the return (Cathay Pacific). Our bags were checked through BKK-SEA.<br>
When boarding in HKG (6 hr stopover) we found out at the gate that my son's bag was delayed, and he was denied boarding for that reason.<br>
The two airlines blamed each other. CP arranged our re-routing because DL did not have another flight until the next day.<br>
Our boarding pass receipts read ""involuntary re-routing"" and ""reason for issuance-late arriving equipment bill to Delta."" My complaint to DL resulted in offers for $50 gift cards, that's all</p>

<p>I started with an online complaint, then an online refund request, replied to one of Delta's responses, then finally sent a letter to their executive team.<br>
We received successive offers: $50 gift cards for each of us, $100 gift cards, $100 gift cards again, $150 gift cards plus $94 for our expenses.<br>
I don't know yet if we can only claim one or if we get all of them (which adds up to being just $500 short of the 400%/max $1,350 compensation rule). </p>

I'm a Chinese citizen and have a used Spain long stay study visa (type D, multi-entry, stay 180 days) that's valid until Apr. 20th.

<p>The answer <a href=""http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/23350/traveling-on-back-to-back-schengen-visas"">here</a> says yes.

<p>I realize the solution is to put these things in checked luggage. I'm trying to establish how worried and reminded I need to be about that. The trip I'm headed on has 26 legs, meaning 26 times through airport security, and that's a lot of packing and unpacking and making sure things are in the right bags. If things need to move bags when they're wet, I'll do it, but if they don't it will be a relief.</p>

<p>For added complications, only one transit will happen in the US, and that is for the final leg that takes me home, where confiscation is less of a worry to me. TSA rules will not apply elsewhere and I don't really know where to find a consistent set of rules that apply worldwide, thought I expect the TSA rules are a reasonable model to go by. I'll be boarding in many different countries but the ones where I might have wet things will be small island nations like Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa and so on.</p>

"How do trams solve the problem of getting too close to each other due to road jams? <p>Imagine a bad road situation where all trams on the same route are stuck because of a jam ahead of them.

"ESTA application status stuck at ""Authorization Pending"". What can I do? <p>As a British citizen, I recently applied for an ESTA visa waiver in order for me to travel to and present at an academic conference in the United States. To my surprise, they have added additional criteria based on travel to certain countries in the Middle East since 2011 (this change was apparently made in December 2015). I stated on my application that I had worked as a lecturer at a specific institution in the Kurdish region of Iraq for a three month period. I expected my application to be denied fairly quickly (although I hoped that it wouldn't) but having checked it several times, there has been no change to the ""Authorization Pending"" status when I check my application on the website. The top of the page (when I check my status) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your travel authorization is under review because an immediate determination could not be made. This response does not indicate negative findings. A determination will be available within 72 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has now been 18 days since I applied - I understand that they may want to check my details more thoroughly and am more than happy for them to - but through various searches on google, I have been unable to find anyone else who had waited so long for a response!</p>

<p>Is it possible for the applications to get stuck in the system? Or is it far more that they're spending this time trying to determine whether I am a security threat? I've heard of people putting in a second application when the first takes a long time - would this be advisable?</p>

<p>In the case that this is too hard to answer in the general case, an answer specifically for China is also acceptable.</p>

<hr>

<p>So far this question has two speculative answers based on guessing what might happen. What I am looking for is more solid information, such as actual laws on this topic from any country, notices or warnings posted at embassies or travel advisories, news reports, blog postings, or forum postings of anybody's personal story where this did turn out to be a real factor. Or if it happened to you yourself! Getting an answer by calling or visiting a consulate or immigration office might also work, but might cause suspicion if you do it while actually applying for a visa.</p>

"Multiple Entry Schengen Visa from Ireland for Indian National <p>I'm currently living in Dublin, I booked tickets to Greece for August, 2016, however when I went to apply for Greek Schengen visa, they said that my Irish visa needs to be valid for at-least 3 months for the date of issue of Schengen visa. </p>

"On an Air France ""train"", can you credit the trip to Flying Blue or SNCF Voyageur? <p>For an upcoming trip, it's looking like the cheapest and simplest way to travel will be a train from Lille to Paris CDG, then a flight onwards from there.

<p>When I look at the flight details, it shows the flight onwards from Paris as normal, but the details of the Lille to Paris ""flight"" leg are:</p>

"How can I manage online a booking for a Malaysian Airlines flight issued by British Airways? <p>Using some BAEC Avios (the British Airways Executive Club ""miles""), I have booked a flight with Malaysian Airlines, who are a OneWorld partner of British Airways (BA). The ticket was issued on BA (125) stock, for the Malaysian flight with a MH flight number. BA have given me a 6 character Amadeus reference, and a 5 character Malaysian reference for the flight.</p>

<p>If I try to use the BA Manage My Booking, with the Amadeus reference, I get the error <em>""Sorry, we are unable to add bookings that do not contain any British Airways flights to your account.""</em>. This error might make sense, were it not for the fact that it happily lets me manage BA ticketed flights with Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Clearly there is more OneWorld ticketing integration on the BA wesbite than the person writing the error message knows... But apparently integration with Malaysian isn't one of the supported one.</p>

<p>Next up, I tried the Malaysian website, and tried to use their <a href=""https://bookings.malaysiaairlines.com/MHOnline/ReservationSearch.do"" rel=""nofollow"">Manage My Booking</a> with the 5 character reference I have. That gives the error <em>""We are unable to process your booking online. Please contact our call center""</em>. </p>

<p>Finally, I tried with the <a href=""https://www.finnair.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">FinnAir website</a>, as I know they are able to manage most OneWorld airline bookings, often even in cases when the ticketing or operating airline won't! FinnAir is able to show me the details of the flight, which is a good start, but sadly isn't able to let me select my seat.</p>

<p>Am I falling down the cracks between not fully integrated OneWorld ticketing systems here? Or is there another trick to let me manage such a booking online? (I've never had much luck with phoning Malaysian Airlines in the past is all....)</p>

<p>In general in our mind we think of flights number as something unique (at least I did). An ID. Often journalists mention the flight number when they want to refer to a particular event (a crash, a forced landing, whatever) which reinforces the idea of uniqueness.</p>

<p>From what I read a flight number:</p>

<ul>
<li>clearly does not represent a plane</li>
<li>does not represent a unique flight in particular (since the same flight number is commonly reused several times to represent the same flight at the same time in different days)</li>
<li>does not represent a route (since the flight number can be used on several routes)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is its use than and does it represent? What makes it unique and usable? can there be, for instance, the same flight number at the same time in different routes?</strong></p>

"Canadian visiting the USA after previously being denied? <p>I am hoping to hear from other people with similar experiences. What I am wondering is, what are the chances that I will be denied entry into the USA, after having been denied in the past? See the explanation below.</p>

<p>I will keep this as short as possible. Roughly 5 years ago, I attempted to fly into the USA from Canada and was denied entry. I was denied because I had overstayed a visit in the past, which I fully admitted and didn't try to fight it. I dug my grave, so to speak..</p>

<p>After being denied, I didn't try to enter again for about 2 years. The next attempt, I drove so as to avoid losing out on a nonrefundable flight. Well, I was granted entry into the country after having my car and luggage thoroughly inspected and questioned. This time though, I had to pay a fee to enter the country and they stapled a form to my passport. The form stated that I was to exit the country by the date that I told the officer. I complied and exited on the date that I reported and I turned the piece of paper over to the Canadian border agent when I came back to Canada, as instructed.</p>

<p>I have not tried to visit the USA since that last time.</p>

<p>Now, my friends and I have a trip planned in August to Las Vegas and I am trying to avoid any complications. We will all be traveling together and flying from Canada to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Do you think I will have any problems this time, after fully complying during my last visit?</p>

<p>I should note that I am a Canadian and I am also a full time student, so I do have ongoing commitments here in Canada. Employment commitment is questionable, as I am on contract at the moment for an internship and it is unknown where/if I will be working at that time.</p>

<p>Also: do people generally book their flights before applying for their visa? </p>

"Mobile Phone Plan for Norway and Europe <p>I currently live in Canada. In a few months, my friends and I will be going to Norway for 9 months for a program at a school in Norway. The trip will be <strong>mostly in Norway but would extend to a large chunk of Europe as well.</strong> Some of the places and countries I would be visiting are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Italy</li>
<li>Athens</li>
<li>Istanbul</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be other placed involved, we haven't gotten the full list yet. </p>

<p>The duration of the trip is 9 months. It will be mostly in Norway (where my friends and I are staying) but we will be taking a backpacking trip through Europe, visiting the locations listed above. We wont be spending much time in each country (few days per country, total of about 2.5 weeks) and since the entire trip is only 9 months or so, I am assuming that a monthly pay as you go plan would probably be the best way to go.</p>

<p>I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S4. I am wondering if there is any way I can buy a SIM card for my phone <strong>in Norway that would also work in the rest of Europe.</strong> I am not looking for something that would allow me to call back to Canada, but instead be something that would allow me to send a few texts to my friends who are also going on the trip (who would get a SIM card just like me) and maybe a little internet. </p>

<p><strong>So does such a plan actually exist and would a SIM card from Norway actually work in my S4 from Canada?</strong> My current provider doesn't provide anything useful and I would have to cancel my current plan anyway.</p>

"UK visit visa refused. Planning to re-apply <p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/24NBF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/24NBF.jpg"" alt=""My refusal letter-my husband did not receive any""></a>My husband had planned to attend a training program in London later in October this year, and he had applied for a Business Visit Visa from Riyadh, KSA. Me and my daughter applied along with him as General Visitors. My husband had attended a training program in London in 2014 as well at the same institute, and we had accompanied him on his visit. We stayed in London for 10 days. That was the first time, me and my daughter received UK visa, whereas my husband had traveled to UK before in 2008 as well, on Business Visit Visa, and had stayed there for about 3 months. That visa was granted from Islamabad, Pakistan. So we do have a history of past travel and compliance.</p>

<p>We were quite sure that our visa will be approved this time around as well, but it was refused. My envelope and my daughters' contained a letter of refusal. Her stated that since her parents had not been granted a visa, her application was being refused as well. Mine stated that since I was dependent on my husband, my visa could not be granted either. It also stated that his was refused because of a substantial amount transferred into his account before the application, which was other than his salary. That amount was transferred by his employer as a performance bonus. We were not aware of the 'PARKING' strategy, and did not attach any evidence of where that transfer came from. Therefore the visa officer was not sure of his financial status, and did not consider him to be a genuine visitor. My husband also has another bank account, in which he keeps his savings. He had not attached a bank statement related to that account thinking of it as unnecessary. He had not attached any evidence of his savings account in his previous application either which got approved.</p>

<p>Also, his envelope did not contain anything other than his passport. There was no letter of refusal. And me and my daughter had a black box stamped on the last page of our passports, which said UK/Riyadh, and had a number hand written on top. His passport did not contain any such stamp. We got to know that his was refused from the letter that came with my passport.</p>

<p>Now his employer wants him to register for the same course in December, and re-apply for the visa. He is going to obtain a letter from the company, endorsing all the extra transfers in his salary account, other than his monthly salaries. He is also planning to attach the bank statement of his savings account, along with that of his salary account. Will they want to know why he did not mention his other account in the previous application? My husband earns well, and we have been settled in Riyadh for about 6 years now. Is there anything else we need to attach with the application this time? We did enclose the invitation letter, letter from the company indicating his designation and salary, our marriage certificate and our daughters'birth certificate. We attached all those documents, that we did last time when our visa got approved. So I assume there was no short-coming in that regard. But now that we have been refused the visa once, I have heard our applications will be undergo stricter scrutiny. Will it take longer than usual now? The next session for the training starts on 7th December, so can we expect an outcome before that? Any suggestions in this regard will be really helpful.</p>

"Declaring illegal substances at customs - what would happen? <p>I've always wondered this.  Occasionally I declare medicines, or wood carvings or whatever when going through customs.  The point of asking you to declare these things is so that they can inspect and prevent say, bug-infested wood from entering New Zealand.</p>

<p>There's usually an amnesty box as well - if you realise at the last minute you have fruit, which you can't bring into New Zealand (just using NZ as an example here), you can dispose of it in their bins, no problem.</p>

<p>Not that I ever would - but hypothetically, if someone came through and for some reason realised they had their illegal drugs stash on them - class A - something really illegal, and they declared it - would customs simply say ""thanks for declaring that, we'll have to take that off you as it's illegal in this country"" or would they arrest you?</p>

"In Malaysia, how should I deal with taxi drivers wanting to go off-meter? <p>I've been to Malaysia three times: once to Penang and twice to Kuala Lumpur.

"Tips and tricks surviving a long-haul flight departing at midnight <p>I am going to travel from Seoul Incheon to Beirut via Abu Dhabi. I have looked up many sites that give tips on traveling long-haul. However, these are not helpful in my case, because there are some factors, mainly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The trip to Incheon takes 4 hours. Seriously. I am staying in the south of the country, and Incheon is up in the north, which will not let me be ""relaxed"" before my flight.</p></li>
<li><p>The plane leaves at 00:40, when most, if not all people, are asleep. Another contributing factor against ""relaxed"".</p></li>
<li><p>The connection time is 5 hours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any tips to surviving this? Most tips I have seen seem to be flights leaving in the afternoon, not midnight.</p>

<p>As a side note, would it be a good idea to wear slippers? Or would my feet bleed because of being run over by other passengers' cabin bags' wheels?</p>

<li>We'll mail you your visa and passport</li>

"How to make myself more visible in traffic as an EU mainland driver in the UK? <p>I will be moving to the UK soon, Scotland to be more precise, and will be doing so with a car. A driver-sitting-on-the-left sort of car, with licence plates from an EU country (eventually I will have to switch to UK plates). The licence plate is white with black numbers and black capital letters (so typically something like ASD-098) - visibly different from a yellow UK plate. </p>

<p>I have never been to a left side driving country, so I will definitely be a bit clumsy first, and drive and turn slower, just to be safe. My licence plates will signal my alien origins (at least until they get switched out to local ones) to the driver immediately behind me and the one coming towards me. I tried to google other, more visible means, but when I search for related keywords, Google Images only spouts tons of Brexit-related bumper stickers at me, which wouldn't help in my case.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there some other good way to visually signal local drivers around me that hey, look here, this guy is slow and clumsy, watch out and keep your distance a bit, he's new to all this drive-on-the-left <s>madness</s> <em>thing</em>? </p>

<p>Some countries, for example, have standardized stickers/signs/plates for new drivers (e.g., under x years of experience), learners, cars with special tires, the handicapped, etc. I'm wondering if there's something out there for experienced drivers re-experiencing learning to drive on the <s>wrong</s> I mean the other, also completely reasonable side.</p>

"Avoiding crowded times in southern Utah national parks and monuments <p>Frequent advice to avoid crowds when visiting national parks in the USA is to travel outside summer (example: (<a href=""http://usparks.about.com/od/nationalparksus/a/avoidcrowds.htm"">1</a>), (<a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/travel-tips-and-articles/698"">2</a>)).  However, some parks have <em>more</em> visitors in May than in July or August.  For example, in <a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Recreation%20Visitors%20By%20Month%20%281979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year%29?Park=CANY"">Canyonlands National Park</a>, <a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Recreation%20Visitors%20By%20Month%20%281979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year%29?Park=NABR"">Natural Bridges National Monument</a>, or <a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Recreation%20Visitors%20By%20Month%20%281979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year%29?Park=CARE"">Capitol Reef National Park</a>, May is the busiest month of the year.  Clearly, visiting in May is not necessarily effective in avoiding crowds in the Southwest².  I suppose it's the climate motivating people to visit in May.</p>

<p>Is there any higher temporal resolution information to avoid crowds, specifically in southern Utah, in parks like Zion, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Staircase-Escalante¹?  In other words, might specific <em>weeks</em> in April or May be much more crowded than others?  Official visitor statistics are monthly. I thought of avoiding spring break, but apparently <a href=""http://www.studentcity.com/when-is-my-spring-break"">“spring” break is in February (!) or March</a>.  <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/npweek/"">National park week</a> was <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_nationalparkweek_2012.htm"">21–29 April 2012</a>, <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_nationalparkweek_2013.htm"">20–28 April 2013</a>, <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_nationalparkweek_2014.htm"">19–27 April 2014</a>, and <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/events_nationalparkweek_2015.htm"">18–26 April 2015</a>, so will presumably be 16–24 April 2016.  Memorial day is in late May.  Apparently, teaching at universities <a href=""http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/calendar/acadcal15.htm"">ends in June</a>, <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g28926-c206331/California:United-States:Public.School.Calendars.html"">the same for other public schools</a>.  So, I'm confused how May is the busiest month — I wonder who all those visitors are, considering that neither students nor families can visit for more than a long weekend, and there anyway aren't any long weekends in April and May except for Memorial Day.  How can I find a 2–3 week period around April/May where one can expect the least crowds in southern Utah?</p>

<hr>

<p>¹<sup>Of course, 6 parks is way too many for 3 weeks, but one reason to travel during a less crowded time is that one can hope to remain flexible and choose the specific park less than a year ahead.</sup></p>

<p>²<sup>I know this is a popular area, so asking for solitude is not realistic, but I suppose a park as large as Grand Staircase-Escalante should not <em>always</em> be as busy as central New York City, or at least not everywhere.</sup></p>

"What limitations are there on my 4 month old UK driving licence for use travelling across Australia? <p>I’m looking into buying a cheap car to use for travelling around Australia but have been spending quite a bit of time trying to ascertain the legalities/pitfalls of doing so with a UK issued licence. I’m 22 years old, passed my test four months ago in the UK and have a twelve month working holiday visa. I arrived about a month ago and wish to travel across a number of territories including (but not necessarily limited to) South Australia, Victoria, the ACT, New South Wales and Queensland. I’m presently in South Australia. Additionally, I don’t currently have an International Drivers Permit (IDP) but plan to acquire one soon (since the UK licence is already in English these aren't necessary but I want to get one anyway in case I need one in the future).</p>

<p>When I arrived I assumed that my UK licence would be sufficient to get behind the wheel of a car and drive off into the sunrise. However, I’ve heard a lot of conflicting information about this; some people have told me I’m only allowed to use my UK licence for three months after arriving in the country while other people tell me I’d have to wear P Plates since I’ve had my licence for under a year. And other people tell me that this is all nonsense and I’m good to go as is, without any restrictions. I’ve found a bit of chatter on forums about this but nothing definitive or authoritative.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the following site in an attempt to answer some of my concerns: <a href=""http://australia.gov.au/faq/existing-licence-driving-in-australia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://australia.gov.au/faq/existing-licence-driving-in-australia</a></p>

<p>It’s the government website so obviously seems more legit that other resources, but I was disappointed to see the following written on there: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As a general rule, you are able to drive in Australia, as a visitor, on a valid overseas driver's licence that covers the same vehicle class for a maximum of three months after arriving in Australia.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m hoping to work for a few months in SA before travelling off to see the rest of Oz by car, so to read that is a bit deflating as it implies red tape I’d rather not have to cut through. However, I’ve set to researching this further and have thus far found very little to substantiate this “general rule”. For example, the ACT website point blank states visiting drivers are not required to obtain a state driving licence. The link to the SA page similarly states <strong>“If your visit is temporary, you may drive the equivalent vehicle in Australia as authorised by your current licence issued to you in your home country”</strong> with no other restrictions. NSW is a bit more complicated, claiming a state licence isn't required so long as you’re only a visitor but goes on to state <strong>“If you are regarded as a temporary overseas visitor and have resided in Australia for a continuous period of at least six months, you may apply for a NSW licence.”</strong>, although I’m interpreting this as an optional thing rather than a necessity. Each site I check seems to say similar things.</p>

<p>Essentially, I’m seeing very little to back up the “maximum of three months” general rule claim on the actual websites for the respective Road and Traffic Authority. It appears that I can drive with my UK licence without any restrictions for the duration of my working holiday stay. So why do I keep hearing about this three month limit for visitors given that there seems to be so little to back it up? I’d appreciate if someone could put my mind to rest and advise me on whether or not I am legally allowed to drive in Australia presently or in the future based on my situation (22 years old, UK licence under a year old, 12 month working holiday visa) and whether there are any restrictions I ought to be aware of. It follows that if my UK Licence is acceptable for Aussie driving then I won't need to bother with P plates, but if I'm wrong then please correct me there (I'd rather not wear them if I could help it but I don't want to do anything illegal).</p>

<p>Anyway, I sorry for this question being kind of long.</p>

"Accepted student with long sejour visa (OFII) to France, but arriving as tourist <p>I have been accepted as student for the 2013 January intake. Since the “lettre de attestation” says the program will start by the 4th of January I suppose my visa will be valid just before the program starts (I am already in the visa application process).
However I bought a flight ticket with my family for the 17th of December arriving in France and staying for two days in Paris and then going to another country in the Schengen zone from de 21st to the 26th. (everything is bought since I wanted them to say goodbye before I move definitely to Europe - fiancee is European).</p>

<p>However since few days ago I realized that if I only have the long-stay visa I wont be able to leave France before passing through the OFII process, I plan to apply for a short term visa with another Schengen country (My fiancee will give me an invitation with exact dates, so it will accelerate the approval process).
My concern is how should I do with dates. </p>

<ul>
<li>What if I asked the short term visa last until the day before the long one starts?. </li>
<li>Can they co-exist for some short period (for example if the short one ends after the long one starts working)</li>
<li>How will I do with the entry stamp on my passport (if I am in France as tourist and get the entry stamp before my long stay starts working, how can I ""activate the long stay one"" and then apply for the normal process?)</li>
<li>Is there any risk I will somehow be considered in ""sejour irreguliere"" status or do I risk not having the chance to enter to France?</li>
</ul>

<p>According to a <a href=""http://diplomatie.gouv.fr/es/IMG/pdf/LS-01d_formulaire_ofii.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">document published on the web</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>si vous souhaitez vous rendre à l’étranger (dans un pays de la zone Schengen ou effectuer un séjour dans votre pays d’origine), assurez-vous que vous êtes en possession de la vignette OFII apposée sur votre passeport, en regard de votre visa ; dans le cas contraire, vous ne serez pas autorisé à rentrer en France sans avoir au préalable sollicité un visa de retour auprès de l’autorité consulaire compétente"".</p>

"Belgium tourist visa refusal, is appealing worth it or not? <p>My husband and I have applied for Belgium tourist visa on September 17th and we were highly confident that we provided all the necessary documents, especially proving the fact that we will leave the country on the scheduled date. Yesterday we received an email implying that our visa application was refused because the reasons and conditions were not well justified. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>l'objet et les conditions du séjour envisagé n'ont pas été justifiés</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We bought flight tickets in advance, but we booked hotel with free cancellation policy to not lose more money in the case of being rejected. The only doubt we had was, not providing any documents showing we are married since all the fund and bank accounts were for one of us (my husband) and I just filled out the application form stating that I am currently studying an MS in Computer Science (last semester) but I provided no evidence whatsoever. I also am a freelance translator and speak over 3 languages fluently, I know it might be unrelated but given that the translation company I work for is quite popular, will it help them understand it is only a tourist visa, being desperate to see Bruges (inspired by the movie, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/"" rel=""nofollow"">in Bruges</a> (as silly as it sounds))? </p>

<p>I wonder if we could appeal and explain the situation more clearly for the consulate. I wouldn't risk reapplying again since the fee is quite high. As I searched their website, they provide no information on appealing, does it mean there is no such an option in their embassy in Iran? Would sending an email help?</p>

<p>Further information: I once applied for a schengen visa and traveled to Germany four years ago before getting married. My husband applied for a UK student visa 5 years ago (thrice) and was rejected. I wonder if we are rejected because of that. </p>

<p>Edit: I have read all the related questions, but I guess such questions must be answered individually, I might be wrong) </p>

<p>There is also another reason that could have made them skeptical. We bought our ticket online which was a fairly cheap flight, then we planned to set an appointment online via Belgium embassy website and found out the earliest available date is October 18th, two days before our planned departure date. We sent the embassy an email requesting for an appointment any time earlier than that with a print of our ticket attached. Then they set us another appointment on Sep 17th (they said the email is for urgent cases only) </p>

"Proof of onward travel when entering the US <p>In a month I will be flying to Boston from the Netherlands on a one way ticket. As far as I know, I will need proof of onward travel to be allowed into the country. Because of this, I'd like to know what possibilities I have. Most options are clear to me, except for the following scenario:</p>

<p>After visiting the East Coast area for 2-3 weeks I will fly to Cancún, to spend about two months in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Because I leave the VWP 'territory' my first 90 day period will end. After visiting these countries I'll return to the United States (overland, via Tijuana, get a I-94 form and a new 90 day period), fly to Hawaii and leave the USA by the end of December. This would be more than 90 days after my first entry to the USA. </p>

<p>The problem in this scenario is: I will have two plane tickets, one to Mexico within the <em>first</em> 90 day period and one to Australia within the <em>second</em> 90 day period. As the first ticket is to Mexico and Mexico doesn't reset the 90 day counter, it might not be enough to prove that I'm actually leaving the VWP territory (although I would, travelling overland to Belize). Because I'm flying to Australia more than 90 days after my first entry I can't prove that I'm leaving in time with just that ticket.</p>

<p>I was wondering if I could/would be denied entry to the USA on my first entry because I don't have enough proof that I'm leaving within the first 90 day period. Would the Mexico ticket &amp; explaining my itinerary be enough, or do I need to have a plane ticket to/from a place outside the USA/Mexico/Canada within those 90 days to prove that I'm actually leaving?</p>

<p>Thanks!
- Lotte</p>

<p>edit:
I don't know yet where I will be staying in Belize and Guatemala or when exactly I will be there, but probably about 2 weeks after the flight to Cancún.
This will be my first (and later second) visit to the United States.</p>

<p>The issue is that going to Mexico doesn't reset the 90 day counter, although I don't know if this also applies if I fly there. Anyway, if Mexico does not reset the counter, I don't have proof that the counter will be reset, because I can't prove that I'm actually going to visit Belize and Guatemala (no flights or reservations there). The only proof I have of really leaving is the ticket to Australia, which is <em>after</em> the initial 90 day period. I'm afraid that if I go with this option, I won't be able to enter the USA on my first visit because I don't have enough proof that I'll actually be leaving within 90 days (and then I won't be able to get my connecting flights either).</p>

<p>Exact wording of the refusal letter quoted here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have refused your application for a  visit visa because I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph A57 of Appendix V: Immigration rules for Visitor because:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>You have said that you will travel to the UK for a period of 26 weeks, to study a general English course. You have said that upon completion of the course you will return to Vietnam looking for a better job. You appear to have completed your full time studies in Vietnam in 2013, and you have been working in administration role since May 2014. You have not sought to continue your studies in your home country since 2013. and you have not undertaken any English course previously, outside of your high school studies. You are employed and receive a monthly income of VND 5,000,000 (GBP 144.70). Of your GBP 144.70 income you spent GBP 100 on living costs. You have said that your study in the UK will cost you GBP 16,000. Therefore I am unclear why you would elected to travel; to the UK now, at the course involved - when courses are available in Vietnam, considerably cheaper.</li>
  <li>As evidence of funds available for your trip you have presented a Sacombank savings book, on 14/08/2015 you credited VND 800,000,000 to this account, this is equal to GBP 23,151, and equates to over 13 years total income, before considering your living costs. As such, I am not satisfied of the origin of these funds, or if they are genuinely available to support your visit now. In light of the above, noting the costs involved, in fact you have not sought to study English previously, and there is no evidence that completion of this course would offer you better employment in Vietnam. Coupled the fact that I am not satisfied that the funds a genuinely available to support you visit means I am not satisfied that you intend to leave the UK at the end of the study. Furthermore, I am not satisfied you have enough funds to support your return journey, or that you will be maintained and adequately accommodated out of funds available to you.</li>

<p>First of all, after completing high school, I was not able to make it to a college or university. I got the job as a arrangement of my father with his friend's company. I could live quite easily without the salary thank to my parent's financial support. In another word, all I needed was just a so called job, no matter how much it would pay me. After a year of being bored of the jobs as well as family dependence, with my parent's encouragement, I decide to go to study abroad to improve my knowledge and experience. I simply think that if I continue being in my country, no matter how much I want to do it, my family will give me everything I need when I am in trouble. And more than to become independent, I want to get a job with my very own sources when I return. I think the course will afford me that.</p>

<p>The funds for my course, obviously, came from my parent. And if the UK Immigration officers have doubt about my return or my bond to my hometown which can assure my return (such as a high salary job or real estate ownership), I just don't know what to show to convince them.</p>

<p>At the moment, all I think of to add to my reapplication are my parent's income statements (though I am not quite sure if it will help because legally, I have been no longer their dependent). Just so you know, I've already had my bank statement, employment description, return ticket booking, study record etc. I'm desperately want this, and even much more after the refusal, I don't want to be called parasite any more.</p>

<p>So could you please help me? What should I prepare and do to reapply? I'm so afraid of being refused again and that would be the end of all of this because every time of being refused, it's only getting harder and harder to apply next time.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to and appreciate your soon advice. Thank you very much.</p>

"Which countries suffix their currency and how much is this stuck to? <p>In most countries I can think of including my own, prices are usually done with the currency symbol first, then the price like ""£12.34"" or ""$98.76"".

<p>How common are prefixing and suffixing in relation to each other? And in countries which use the ""minority"" system, how rigorously is this adhered to?

"Finding **cheapest** fares from a country to country/city/airport (including non-guaranteed connections)? <p>I've recently spent some time finding the cheapest fares for my journey and that got me thinking.</p>

<p>Essentially I'm traveling UK &lt;-> Tallinn (Estonia) anytime within the next 4 months for a week. But I'm not bothered travelling through other airports or countries if that makes my journey cheaper (and as a EU citizen with no checked in luggage all the transfers shouldn't be a big hassle).</p>

<p>So currently if I search for MAN &lt;-> TLL in flights.google.com that gives me the cheapest return for the end of May for about £190 with transfers (that's only because I've already bought my tickets so using end of May as an example to compare prices).</p>

<p>I live near Manchester but if I buy my tickets in advance (which I usually try to do) it doesn't matter if I fly from Manchester Airport, Edinburgh Airport, any airport in London or possibly anywhere from in the UK. Although it's less hassle to get back home from Manchester Airport - any airport in the UK presumably is fine for me as long as it's cheap (just an example to prove what I mean: I've spent £16.50 for the train ticket to get from Lancashire to Stansted Airport (London) and £14.05 to get from Manchester Airport back home, so there really is no big difference in price).</p>

<p>And if I choose London (all airports) &lt;-> TLL that gives me around £100 for a direct return.</p>

<p>So currently I have purchased the following tickets: STN->TLL (£36.71), TLL->DUB (~£23.84), DUB->MAN (~£7.94). So that's about £69 in total for a ""return"".
And I could have reduced that price even more (by buying STN->RYG (£13) &amp; RYG->TLL (£12) instead of a direct one but I got a direct one because that one was better for me for that specific day only), or also had an option to fly MAN->DUB, DUB->TLL that would be again cheaper than my direct flight STN->TLL.</p>

<p>So the question is: I can of course find these routes and prices manually but it will take me days to look up every possible route between the UK and Tallinn (Estonia) and compare all the possible prices to narrow it down to 1-5 cheap options to choose from. I've used flights.google.com and skyscanner.net (and possibly some other ones) but none of them are able to find these cheap rotes that I can find manually (which is disappointing). <strong>Is there any website-software-anything that can find the cheapest tickets with layovers/transfers through other airports/countries from a country that I choose (for example the UK) to a country/city/airport (for example Estonia or Tallinn or TLL)?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for the long question but I had to provide my example to make it clear that the usual websites doesn't seem to find what I want to find.</p>

<p>EDIT1: Although broad searching is one aspect of my question, the most important one is actually finding the cheap connections automatically. Google or Skyscanner didn't see the possibility of flying cheaper like MAN->DUB->TLL or STN->RYG->TLL,  the only cheap option it knows about is the direct flight STN->TLL with Ryanair, although somehow the more expensive flights that it finds are with connections, so it can find flights with connections just not the cheap ones!</p>

<p>EDIT2: I've accepted Tor-Einar Jarnbjo's answer that explains why I couldn't find these cheap flights but if anyone knows a website that can still find these cheap flights please let me know! I accept all the risks!</p>

"Cancel a Hotel Room After Checking in Online <p>I'm asking specifically about Hilton properties, but you can answer generally too. Once I check in to a hotel room online or in the hotel app, can I still cancel my reservation, for instance, if my flight is delayed as long as I'm within the hotel's cancellation window (often 6PM same day)?</p>

"Using 2 Passports <p>We are dual Uk Aus citizens visiting Manchester for 5 weeks. Is it ok for my wife and I to enter on my uk passport to perhaps save time at Man airport? We will leave Aus on our Aus passports. Are there any other advantages by having a Uk passport in the Uk?
Thanks</p>

"What's the typical microclimate in the aircraft passenger cabin? <p>When preparing for a commercial jet flight it'd be nice to know how warm my clothes should be so that I don't freeze after sitting for several hours in say +16 degrees Celsius (61 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>What's the typical temperature in the passenger cabin? Are there air drafts? How cold and how warm can it reasonably get?</p>
