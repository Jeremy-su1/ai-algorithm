  <p>According to Ernst Mayr, any Lamarckian theory involving the inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as ""DNA does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA.""[75] Peter J.

"Why isn't the upper limit of pain lower in humans? <p>From what I understand, pain is an useful mechanism that signals us that something is not quite right with our body (in particular, we're under attack). It's good - it alert us and tells us that we got to do something (stop the threat, or run away, etc). From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to
  protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar
  experiences in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there are damages that cause <em>too much pain</em>. If you are stabbed in a particular place, you will most likely have so much pain that you simply can't fight back or run away. The shock makes it incredibly hard to <em>do something</em> or even <em>think properly</em>.</p>

<p>So my question is: is there a reason why pain can elevate to such high levels? I'm just assuming that if we had some sort of hard limit on the amount of pain we receive, we could perform better in several dangerous situations. In other words: instead of hurting so much that we can't even think properly, it hurts <em>enough</em> to let us know we are in grave danger but still capable of assess the situation and perhaps even act accordingly.</p>

<p>Obviously some physical damages will render you unable to act anyway. Like, damages on the spine that may cause your limbs to malfunction. But I mean damages such as a large open wound on the abdomen: if that didn't hurt so much, I'd imagine you could probably stand up and run away (you'd probably bleed out but at least you'll have a chance to escape the threat).</p>

<p>My guess is that it ""cannot be helped"". Pain are signals from different parts of the body to the brain, and once a signal is sent, the brain has no choice but to process it accordingly.</p>

"Cranial Nerve Decussation <p>I want to get my head round this once and for all so if you guys could help me would really appreciate it! I understand lesions to the optic nerve. It is the other nerves that I find difficult. </p>

<p>So far this is my understanding, please correct me if I'm wrong. The cranial nerves do not decussate generally with exceptions being CN2, CN4, CN7 and CN12. That means if a lesion affects Cranial Nerve 1, 5, 8, 9 and 11 or the respective nucleus there is either sensation loss or atrophy of the muscle (dependent on what the nerve does) of the ipsilateral side. For example in a lesion affecting CN6, the eye cannot look out in the side of the lesion. </p>

<p>In the case of CN4, I'm not too sure what happens but I imagine if there is damage to the nucleus the opposite side is affected (meaning superior oblique in the contralateral side will not work). If the nerve is affected, it is typically the ipsilateral side. The same I imagine is true for CN12. </p>

<p>In CN7, the forehead is bilaterally innervated so if the upper motor neurone is affected eyebrows can be raised but the lower side of the face is affected ipsilaterally. In a lower motor neurone lesion, there is complete loss of one side of the face ipsilaterally.</p>

"What is the importance of hydrogen bonds in water? and other questions: <p>These are extremely simple questions — basic biology — but I would like to make sure that the way I have answered is at the very least correct. </p>

<ol>
<li>Hydrogen bonds are very weak, so how is it possible that they are so important in the properties of water? <em>Hydrogen bonds in water provide many characteristic benefits to water: cohesion (holding water molecules together), high specific heat (absorbing heat when breaking, releasing heat when forming; minimizing temperature change), high heat of vaporization (several hydrogen bonds must be broken in order to evaporate water), lower density of ice (molecules in ice are spaced farther apart), and solubility (polar molecules are attracted to ions and polar compounds, making them soluble in water).</em>  </li>
<li>Why do we feel cooler immediately after we go swimming than we do after we have fully dried off? <em>We feel cooler immediately after we go swimming than we do after we have dried off because it takes a lot of heat to evaporate water; however, once we dry off we remove much of the water from our skin, and the water is evaporated much more quickly.</em> </li>
<li>If water were non-polar, would our temperature heat up less quickly or more quickly if we went outside on a hot day? Why? More quickly. <em>Because hydrogen bonds within water slow down the movement of molecules and allow for water to have a very high specific heat.</em> </li>

"Why are potassium channels slower than sodium channels? <p>I am relatively new in the subject of biology. I have a strong mathematical background and in order to get into the field of computational neuroscience, I am trying to get some biological background.</p>

<p>I am reading about the general mechanism of action potentials in neurons.
I understand that an action potential starts with a fast entrance of sodium into the postsynaptic cell. <strong>Since the potassium channels are slower than the sodium channels,</strong> potassium starts flowing out of the cell only around the peak of the action potential, thereby hyperpolarizing the cell's membrane potential.</p>

<p>What is the mechanism that causes the potassium channels to activate slower than the sodium channels? Does it involve differences in the behavior of the suitable neurotransmitters?

"Valid comparison of gene expression between several genes in several cell lines <p>We have gene expression data (Affimetrix mRNA gene expression results) for several cell lines, over a set of genes.

"Height and natural selection in humans? <p>I watched the documentary ""Evolve"" recently and in the segment on ""size"" Scott V. Edwards, Harvard evolutionary biologist mentioned the idea that humans might evolve to be 7' tall in 'hundreds of years'. (I think this may have been taken out of context... I have emailed him to find out, but do not expect a response from someone so busy)</p>

<p>The reasoning goes that the trend in the past 100 years has been greater height, and women show a strong preference for men who are taller than they are. (Though a large share perhaps all of this difference has been due to diets higher in protein at an early age) </p>

<p>I wonder, though, if this is only part of the story. The preference women have is not just for tall men, but for a man who is taller than she is. Likewise, men seem to prefer woman who are shorter than they are. There is even cultural pressure: the classic western image of a couple on wedding cake always shows a man who is about 4"" (to scale) taller than the bride.</p>

<p>Thus, women who are short have an advantage as they have a greater pool of men to choose from. (Colloquially, simply ask any 6' tall woman if she feels her height helps her find dates.) </p>

<p>Let's say that men seek women who are shorter than they are, but no more than 8"" shorter. Women seek men who are taller than they are but no more than 8"" taller. Given that the current average height for men is 5'8"" and for women it is 5'4"" (and distributed normally SD 2.8"") will we have selective pressure that leads to greater or lesser height?

"Dreadnoughtus: Why are new taxa named using Dog Latin? <p>Once upon a time, binomial nomenclature was expected to follow Latin rules: the genus had to be a noun and the species had to be an adjective that agreed with the genus according to Latin rules of adjectival agreement with the noun modified by it.

<p>Enter 2014, and with it such new binomials as the ponderous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadnoughtus""><em>Dreadnoughtus schrani</em></a>.

"Can paper/plastic currency serve as a medium for pathogens? <p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/health/15real.html"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/health/15real.html</a> seems to indicate for a surface, to serve as a medium, the following properties are relevant </p>

<ul>
<li>animation </li>
<li>humidity  </li>
<li>temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>The article however does not elaborate on the properties a surface <em>must</em> possess to serve as a medium - albeit i would figure it may vary from one virus/bacterium to another.</p>

<p>The same article also states </p>

<pre><code>... when objects in a hotel room — light switches, telephones — were contaminated 
with a  cold virus, 60 percent of healthy volunteers picked up the virus when they 
touched one of the objects an hour later. Eighteen hours later, the transmission rate 
was cut in half.
</code></pre>

<p>When currency changes hands we rarely ever know whether it may , within a reasonable timespan, have passed through an agent/carrier.</p>

<p>Sir Dumpty loves to sneak off with a currency note to get me to chase him. He is protected; another member of his species may not be so protected. For that matter a person infected with, say, the common cold virus may have passed a note/coin/card to the vendor at the store within a minute of sneezing/coughing into his/her hand. What if the same person , instead, suffered from TB?</p>

<p>So ... can currency serve as a medium for transmission of pathogens?</p>

"Why is triclosan not considered an antibiotic? <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan"">Triclosan</a> is a chemical often referred to as a ""biocide"" instead of an ""antibiotic"". However, its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan#Mechanism_of_action"">mode of action</a> seems to suggest that it is an antibiotic. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Triclosan binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase
  (ENR) enzyme, which is encoded by the gene FabI. This binding
  increases the enzyme's affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+). This results in the formation of a stable, ternary complex of
  ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid
  synthesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nearly identical to the action of many other antibiotics, such as penicillins (inhibits cell wall synthesis enzymes), quinolones (inhibit DNA gyrase) or sulfonamides (inhibit folate synthesis). </p>

<p>In fact, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11506900"">this paper</a> describes the mechanism of resistance to triclosan and notes that it is identical to many antibiotics. Why then, is triclosan not classified as an antibiotic and is still prophylatically used in so many places (such as hospitals)?</p>

<p>This is a native gel. Let's call the left 2 lanes protein A and the right 2 lanes protein B. B is the same as A except it has a FLAG tag. They are both homotetramers of about 65 kDa. After purification, both appeared as single bands on SDS-PAGE. However, these are relatively old samples and I expect multiple bands due to degradation (which I've observed with previous samples). Either way, I cannot for the life of me resolve them with native PAGE. B is somewhat workable, though still atrocious. For each of A and B, I've loaded 5 and 15 uL (hence why there are two lanes for each) with 5 uL of 5X loading buffer. Yes, I know that's not the correct ratio; I can't imagine that being my problem but I'm running it again with the correct ratio. The rest of the conditions are pretty standard:</p>

<p>Full Case Study: (Its the last of 6 cases and I just can't figure this one out,  because of all the possibilities, there is always something that doesn't line up.)</p>

<p>The 26-year-old man presented for evaluation of a neck mass and a right axillary mass. The patient, who came to the United States from Vietnam 6 1/2 years ago, noted  midline neck mass. The mass gradually increased in size. Approximately 3 weeks prior to admission, he noted a midline neck mass. These masses were incised and drained twice. Samples of purulent material were sent for routine bacterial culture at an outside hospital. The patient had lost 3 kg (ca. 7 lbs) in the 2 months prior to admission but denied fever. Travel history was notable for his having lived in Arizona for 6 years prior to moving to Boston.</p>

<p>On examination, he was afebrile. An erythematous , fluctuant, nontender mass (8cm x 6cm) was present in the midline of the neck. (Fig. 5.1)  (computed tomogram[CT] scan in fig. 5.2).The right axilla demonstrated incision sites that were draining and were tender to palpation. He had no adenopathy elsewhere. His (PPD) purified protein derivative skin test was reactive, and his chest x-ray was notable for apical scarring in the right lung.</p>

<p>Because of the positive PPD and apical scarring seen on the patient's chest x-ray, the clinical suspicion of cervical ________ was high, and the patient was begun on a four drug anti- _________________ regimen. </p>

<p>Several days after the neck mass was drained of several milliliters of purulent material for culture, a mold was found to grow on the blood agar plates in the routine bacteriology section of the microbiology laboratory. The mold was white (Fig. 5.3) and initially did not have any identifying characteristics when a lactophenol cotton blue preparation was examined under a phase-contrast microscope. It was subcultured at both room temperature and body temperature, and after subculture began to demonstrate the presence of  spores microscopically (Fig. 5.4) The identification was confirmed by using a commercially available genetic probe.</p>

"Weinman AIF and High temporal resolution AIF difference <p>I'm dealing with MRI DCE maps. Actually I need to find such parameters as the transfer constant $K^{trans}$ and rate constant $k^{ep}$ according to the two-compartment model.
Mathematically, this dynamic system can be described by the following equation:
$$C_t(t)=DK^{trans} \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 a_i [exp(-k^{ep}t) - exp(-m_it)]/[m_i-k_{ep}]$$
Now if I have contrast agent concentration $C_t(t)$ time series from experiment I can extract transfer constant $K^{trans}$, and rate constant $k^{ep}$ by least square fitting. The only problem is that I need to know $a_i$ and $m_i$ constants. For this purpose I use the next formula for blood plasma concentration: $$c_p(t)=D \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 a_i exp(-m_it)$$
However I can't find the relation between the blood plasma concentration: $c_p(t)$ and $c_t(t)$. In the next article:
 Geoff J.M. Parker et. al. ""Experimentally-Derived Functional Form for a Population-Averaged High-Temporal-Resolution Arterial Input Function for Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI""

"Entropy and Open Systems - AP Biology <p>I had the following question on an exam of mine and I got the points for the question, but I am wondering if someone could please explain why it is correct, or rather, <em>if</em> it is correct at all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As living organisms grow, they increase in complexity and decrease in entropy. How does this relate to the second law of thermodynamics?</p>
  
  <p>(A) Living organisms, like everything else in the universe, spontaneously decrease in entropy over time.</p>
  
  <p>(B) The increase in entropy of the universe exactly balances out the decrease in entropy as the organism grows.</p>
  
  <p>(C) Energy cannot be created or destroyed, so the energy used for growth is later used to increase entropy.</p>
  
  <p>(D) The resulting increase in entropy of the universe is greater than the decrease in entropy associated with the growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I answered D, as it seemed like the most likely answer out of all of them, and I got the points.</p>

<p>According to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, the entropy of the universe will increase with time. </p>

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong, but from my understanding this only applies to closed systems--so how exactly would it apply to organisms (which are open systems)? Is it because organisms release heat through chemical reactions and thus add to the entropy of the universe while decreasing their own entropy?</p>

"In what circumstances does a mammalian egg copy its DNA? <p>In the 2nd episode of the new Cosmos series, the host Neil deGrasse Tyson shows how the white-furred bear could have evolved (reasonable scientific speculation, of course).</p>

<p>If you haven't seen that episode, <a href=""http://www.cosmosontv.com/watch/195050051992"" rel=""nofollow"">here's the link</a>. Great show, by the way.</p>

<p>So, it shows the bears eggs, and then goes on to show how there can happen an error in the DNA copying, that leads to the brown pigment production malfunction. Here's an excerpt from the subtitles text:</p>

<pre><code>- great bears roamed the frozen wastes of Ireland.
- This might look like an ordinary bear,
- but something extraordinary is happening inside her.
- Something that will give rise to a new species.
- In order to see it, we'll need to descend down to a much smaller scale, to     the cellular level, so that we can explore the bear's reproductive system.
..
- Those are some of her eggs.
- To see what's going on in one of them,
- we'll have to get even smaller.
- We'll have to shrink down to the molecular level.
..
- When a living cell divides in two,
- each one takes away with it a complete copy of the DNA.
- A specialized protein proofreads to make sure
- that only the right letters are accepted
- so that the DNA is accurately copied.
- But nobody's perfect.
- Occasionally, a proofreading error slips through,
- making a small, random change in the genetic instructions.
- A mutation has occurred in the bear's egg cell.
- A random event as tiny as this one can have consequences on a far grander scale.
- That mutation altered the gene that controls fur color.
- It will affect the production of dark pigment in the fur
- of the bear's offspring.

<p>From my (not professional but kind of passionate amateur) knowledge of biology, I I was under impression that all of the mammalian eggs are present at birth. But the story depicted in the show involves the (erroneous) DNA copying. I see dissonance there, and I'd like to solve it.</p>

"Does trypsin strip flask coating? <p>Mammalian cell/tissue cultures sometimes require flasks coated with proteins. My uneducated guess is that these proteins mimic the ECM, perhaps the basal lamina, so finicky contact-dependent cells can attach to it.</p>

<p>For instance, I have a <a href=""http://www.atcc.org/products/all/CRL-9609.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">BEAS-2B</a> tracheal culture which requires a coating of albumin, fibronectin and type I collagen. This is applied by incubating an empty plastic dish or flask with a solution of these proteins overnight. I give this as an example of what a ""coat"" constitutes. You answer should be general enough to apply to at least the most common coat types, or if it depends on the coat, you should explain how.</p>

<p>Likewise, there is some variation in how the trypsinization occurs. To have a starting point, let's say I am trypsinizing according to typical ATCC recommendations: 5 minutes with 0.25% Trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA, then inactivate with equal volume medium. I haven't worked with a cell that can withstand this noticeably (but then I haven't worked with any exotic cells).</p>

<p><strong><em>My question:</em></strong> When I trypsinize the cells to passage, what happens to the coat?</p>

<p>Since trypsin is a protease that cleaves even the attachment of cells to plastic, I am guessing that it will also destroy the coat. After the trypsin and cells are removed, the flask will have a tiny fraction of the protein coat that it had before, and will not support cells that require a coat any longer.</p>

<p>Am I correct in thus deducing that coated flasks cannot be reused after trypsinization? Are any of the alternative detachment reagents an exception to this?</p>

"Burns' ""To a mouse"" - what species of mouse? <p>What's the most likely mouse species Robert Burns is referring to in his poem ""To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest with the Plough"". </p>

<p>Burns farmed near Ayr, which is on the Firth of Clyde in Scotland. So the mouse of his poem would have to live in that area in the late 18th century. The creature obviously was living in an open field in December in a nest made of ""leaves an' stibble [stubble]"". From the poem's title it appears like the nest was constructed underground. ""Sleekit"" refers to sleek coated as in shiny fur. A clue to the mouse's diet is given by ""A daimen icker in a thrave"", ie grain.

"Compressing structural information in PDB files <p>There seems to be a lot of redundancy in PDB files.  These files can of course be compressed with general-purpose compression programs like gzip, but I can't help but imagine that these tools are overlooking a significant amount of redundancy in PDB files.  Are there compressors that specifically target PDB files?  If not, what are some aspects of PDB files that are ripe for compression?</p>

<p>These two residues occupy 1,638 bytes as plain text; when compressed with gzip, they occupy 467 bytes.  For reference, the format of ATOM records in PDB files is defined at wwpdb.org/documentation/format33/sect9.html#ATOM.</p>

<p>Almost all of the data in the above excerpt seems redundant.  The first field (ATOM), second field (atom index, e.g. 332 in the first row), sixth field (residue index, e.g. 42), tenth field (occupancy, e.g. 1.00) and last field (element name, e.g. N) seem clearly extraneous.  The fourth field (residue name) could be shortened from three characters to 1 character, or simply an integer.  I'm not a data compression expert, but I imagine gzip picks up most of this redundancy.</p>

<p>Slightly less obviously, the atom names for each residue also seem unnecessary.  To my understanding, the atomic composition of all residues' backbones will always be the same, and represented in PDB files as ""N"", ""CA"", ""C"", ""O"".  The same for the atomic composition of the residues' respective sidechains: a lysine sidechain will always be ""CB"", ""CG"", ""CD"", ""CE"", ""NZ"" and a phenylalanine sidechain will always be ""CB"", ""CG"", ""CD1"", ""CD2"", ""CE1"", ""CE2"", ""CZ"".  </p>

<p>A subtler redundancy, but one that might increase compressibility a lot, seems like it could be in the atomic coordinates themselves.  For example, in the backbone, would it be possible to deduce each residue atom's X, Y and Z coordinates (12 data points: 4 atoms * 3 coordinates) given only their phi, psi and omega <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dihedral_angle&amp;oldid=474965018#Dihedral_angles_of_biological_molecules"" rel=""nofollow"">dihedral angles</a> (3 data points)?  Could applying dihedral angles to atoms within sidechains similarly remove the need to explicitly list the 3D coordinates there?</p>

<p>Could ""temperature  factor"" (the second to last field in the excerpt) be losslessly removed, or compressed in some non-obvious way?  What are some other possible optimizations that could be used to more efficiently compress PDB files?  Are there any obvious grave performance implications of these various compression techniques on the speed of a hypothetical decompressor to convert back to the official PDB format?  Have these questions been answered in the literature or an existing PDB-specific compression program?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers or feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Given that no PDB-specific file compressors seem to be available, I suppose my specific goal is to develop one.  One potential application I see for this is in significantly decreasing fresh times-to-render in certain use cases of browser-based molecular visualization programs, e.g. <a href=""http://jmol.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jmol</a>, <a href=""http://web.chemdoodle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ChemDoodle Web Components</a> or <a href=""http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp/glmol/viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLmol</a>.  Another application could be decreasing the time and size of data needed to download archives of PDB files like those described <a href=""http://www.wwpdb.org/downloads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>This would of course require a way to efficiently decompress the packed PDB files, but this trade-off between decompression time and download time seems like it could be useful in at least some niche applications.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>:</p>

<p>In a comment, nico asks ""How would compressing the file decrease render time?"".  Decreasing gzipped PDB file size (e.g. by half or more) and thus decreasing time needed to download the file would decrease the time between when the PDB file was requested from a remote server and when the structure was rendered by a molecular visualization program running on a client machine. Apologies if that use of ""fresh time-to-render"" in that context was unclear.</p>

<p>A lossless compression could also involve encoding the PDB file to an object (e.g. JSON) that is faster to parse for the visualization program, and decrease render times that way.  Looking around further, if the application only required displaying the 3D structure and not also retaining data about specific atoms and residues, then using a binary mesh compression (e.g. <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/webgl-loader/"" rel=""nofollow"">webgl-loader</a>) seems like it would probably decrease time-to-render even more.</p>

"Is ""aggregate percentage"" still a valid term in ecology? <p><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/3795806"" rel=""nofollow"">Martin et al. 1946</a> define ""aggregate percentage"" as a metric that describes the mean percentage contribution of a group to the total mass/abundance of all samples. The metric is useful in datasets that are plagued by outliers and non-normality, something that is a commonplace with most ecological community and diet studies in my experience. Aggregate percentage is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>$AP_i = \frac{100\%}{N_y} \times \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{N}(\frac{a_{ij}}{\sum a_j})$</p>

<p>Where i is the i$^{th}$ taxon, j the j$^{th}$ sample, N total number of samples, a$_{ij}$ the abundance or mass of i$^{th}$ taxon in j$^{th}$ sample, and $\sum a_j$ the summed abundance or mass of all taxa in j$^{th}$ sample.</p>

"What is the role of Aspartate Transaminase in gluconeogenesis? <p>I know that oxaloacetate cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane, but can instead be converted to aspartate, shuttled out, and then re-converted back to oxaloacetate.  What does this have to do with gluconeogenesis?</p>

<p>The traditional route is to convert pyruvate to OAA to malate in the mitochondria, shuttle the malate out, and then convert malate back to OAA in the cytosol.  If lactate is the precursor, then the conversion of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol can generate an NADH, making the conversion to malate in the mitochondria unnecessary.  Thus, OAA is converted directly to PEP in the mitochondria by mitochondrial PEPCK and shuttled out to the cytosol to begin gluconeogenesis.</p>

"PDB Mining: Why Do I Find Atoms Less than 1 Angstrom Apart? <p>I am attempting to find potential Hydrogen bonds between Hydrogen donors and aromatic ring acceptors.  I do this by predicting the location of Hydrogens on residues and then calculating how far these Hydrogens are from aromatic rings.  If a certain Hydrogen is &lt;7.0 Angstroms from a certain aromatic ring, then I take it under consideration: I form the N-H vector, which is the vector created by the Hydrogen under question and the Nitrogen in the backbone of the residue that the Hydrogen belongs to.  I test that this N-H vector is pointing toward the plane of the aromatic ring, and I also test that the point of intersection between the plane of the aromatic and the N-H vector is within 6 Angstroms of the center of the aromatic ring.  </p>

<p>If all of these conditions are met, then I consider it a Hydrogen bond between the Hydrogen and the aromatic ring.

"Why perform imputation? <p>Genetics datasets contain measurements for millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Some (usually small) percentage of these values are of low confidence, and are labeled as missing values.

"What causes humans to be physically weak compared to animals like gorillas? <p>Animals like gorillas seem to have a physical fitness and muscle mass that don't depend as strongly on how much exercise they get, compared to humans. E.g. gorillas living in the wild sleep and rest a lot. While they do get quite a bit of exercise (a lot more than the average human), they are not going to exert themselves much more than is necessary. So, they push themselves a lot less than people who exercise very hard. Yet the average gorilla would easily outperform even a well trained human being in bodyweight exercises.</p>

"Is it really detrimental to humans as a species to reproduce with one's own first cousin? <p>Tired of hearing of these urban legends and popular opinions, I ask this question here to see if there really is scientific merit to this belief. My questions is, is it really ""harmful"" for a person to reproduce with his/her own first cousin? Everyone, at least in America, seems to think that this is incest which I completely dismiss because incest is purely a religious concept. The next argument I get is that we want more genetic diversity and having offspring with a first cousin is detrimental to our survival as a species. If you have any genetic weaknesses then your cousin is likely to be carrying them as well and then the chances of your offspring carrying them increase and so on.</p>

<p>I don't really believe any of this. It is rather well known (or may be not so well known) that only a very small percentage of a human individual is different from another human individual's genome. Differences due to skin color, race, ethnicity, and such are literally skin deep. So one reproducing with her cousin or someone half way across the globe is only negligibly different.</p>

<p>Forgetting about religion, has this been scientifically systematically tested and/or proven? Has any research been done on this? Is it true one way or the other?

"Help with designing the analysis of radio telemetry study <p>I was wondering if there are any spatial ecologists out there who can provide some insight on the trouble I'm having with my Masters research.</p>

<p>I am looking at the association a bat species to high density aggregations of a flowering plant. The bats were tracked throughout the night with a point taken at approximately 10 minute intervals. The bats were tracked over consecutive nights until an asymptote in their space use was reached. So now I have point patterns for each bat that pretty much covers the entirety of their space use at that period. </p>

<p>When the data is displayed visually there is a clear pattern of the bats that were tracked during the flowering period moving into the aggregations of the plant however they also spend a lot of time foraging around their roost sites. </p>

<p>I have simulated the point pattern of each bat 999 times by randomly shifting and rotating the points within the study window (the internal structure of the observed pattern was maintained in the simulations to account for autocorrelation). I then did randomisation tests to see if the average distance to the nearest plant aggregation for the observed data is within the lower 5% of the distribution of the averages for the simulated point patterns. However because the majority of the points collected are highly associated with the roosts the average distance is primarily effected by the position of the roost in relation to any of the plant aggregations.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of ways to disentangle the association with roosts and the association with the plant. </p>

<p>First I was thought about putting a buffer around the roosts and removing the points falling within these buffers from the analysis. The problem is deciding on a buffer. In the other areas I have been using a buffer equal to the circular error probable of the radio tracking error but placing this around the roost will only incorporate the points where the bat was actually inside the roost not foraging around it. All the bats have different foraging patterns around their roosts and I can't see how to assign a buffer distance that is not completely arbitrary.</p>

<p>The second method we have been looking into is taking out the points that are more closely associated (closer in distance) with the roost than the nearest plant aggregation and then running the randomisation to look at the association of the remaining points to the plant. I want to get an idea of whether or not removing the association with the roosts in this way will potentially bias the analysis.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or further suggestions?!</p>

"Acknowledging differentiation of species, in historical times <p>This is at least partly an historical question, and I am not even remotely a biologist of any sort, so apologies beforehand if it's a little obscure.</p>

<p>I often wonder how many distinctions were made in pre-Renaissance times, between species of animals.</p>

<p>For example, though I'm sure there have always been those with enough of an interest in nature to tell subtle differences, how were lemmings or voles, for example, told apart from rats or mice? Or did this recognition of speciation only come later, once more detailed (intrusive) forms of analysis became common?</p>

<p>I've looked up the etymologies for vole, lemming and hamster and all are dated post-Renaissance, so at least in these instances it <em>may</em> be safe to assume that people might simply not have noticed the differences before closer study took place. But I guess there are other animals where the same question applies (particularly smaller, harder-to-scrutinise animals where there are a large number of species similar at a glance).</p>

<p>EDIT: <em>Vole</em> means field (same root as <em>wold</em>), giving rise to the 19th c. term <em>volemouse</em>, meaning that originally, mouse and vole were indeed seen as one and the same -- proof of point.</p>

"How and when did a dedicated immune system evolve? <p>I have recently been doing a lot of research into the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems in humans, and mammalian laboratory models. This has led to my reading some <a href=""http://www.cnrs.fr/Cnrspresse/en40a2.html"">interesting information on the immune response in insects</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insects have a highly efficient immune system.  In response to a bacterial attack, their fat body (the equivalent of the liver in mammals) synthesizes a whole range of peptides with an antibacterial and antifungal effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fascinated me, as the clear inference is that there are no ‘dedicated’ immune cells, but that adipose tissue has far more diverse functions that I had realized.</p>

<p>I have done a little more reading, and also looked at plant immune systems, which seems far more analogous to those in insects than mammals;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plants, unlike mammals, lack mobile defender cells and a somatic adaptive immune system. Instead, they rely on the innate immunity of each cell and on systemic signals emanating from infection sites.
  (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05286"">Jones, 2006</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions relates to the <em>need</em> of an adaptive immune response in mammals. The immune systems in insects and plants - a more 'systemic' immunity due to the lack of dedicated/mobile immune cells - seems much simpler. </p>

<p>Given that evolution works incrementally (there are no 'jumps' - for instance, going from a non-dedicated immune system, to a dedicated immune system), I would hypothesise that organisms less distantly related to insects and plants may have tissues with duel functions (similar to insects?), but that specialize further as immune cells until gradually (down the evolutionary tree) a complex and specific immune system emerges. (This is complicated by the fact that our immune systems do have multiple roles - e.g. tissue remodelling, but I wasn't going to go into that here. Feel free in your answers if it is necessary!).</p>

I'm working on designing a totally new system of liquid/gas cooling for a project.

<p>In some places, however, there are majestic stands of pines - often completely free of the ""seasonal"" variety of trees.</p>

<p>Why is this?  What allows the slow growing pines to out-compete the other arboreal denizens of the forest?  And generally in such particular areas?</p>

"Which factors besides the thermodynamic stability are important for the hairpin in intrinsic transcription termination? <p>Intrinsic termination (rho-independent) relies on a stable hairpin with a subsequent uridine repeat. The common explanation on how these sequences cause the termination of the transcription are based on the thermodynamic stability of the sequence. The GC-rich stable hairpin together with the destabilizing U-repeat supposedly destabilize the binding of the polymerase enough to cause it to disassociate from the template.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any specific requirements on the hairpin sequence beyond a certain thermodynamic stability. </li>

<li>Light-independent reactions</li>
<li>Calvin cycle</li>

<li>Grow light</li>

<h2>Does ceaseless light exposure with proper spectrum adversely affect a day-neutral plant?</h2>

<p>As a layman I have started to fumble towards light-independent reactions, but I have not found strong claim. I have learnt that there are processes which taking place during dark phase, but <strong>are these reactions impossible in presence of light?</strong></p>

"How to understand relatedness in an infinite island model? <p>My understanding is that the relatedness coefficient in kin selection models measures <em>positive assortment</em>. That is, altruism is more likely to evolve if altruists tend to interact with other altruists. As an example, consider a general model of kin selection due to Queller (Queller 1992 ""A general model of kin selection""). According to this model, relatedness is viewed as the regression coefficient $\beta_{G'G}$, where $G$ is the individual's frequency of the altruism allele and $G'$ is the average value of $G$ of an individual's neighbors. Queller's definition of relatedness is a measure of positive assortment because, by definition, 
$$\beta_{G'G} = \frac{E(G'\mid G) - E(G')}{G - E(G)}$$</p>

<p>If relatedness is positive, if the focal individual is more altruist than average ($G-E(G)&gt;0$), then this individual will tend to interact with individuals that are more altruist than average ($E(G'\mid G) - E(G')&gt;0$).</p>

<p>Now, in Taylor's 1992 kin selection model in patch-structured populations with asexual reproduction (""Altruism in viscous populations""), relatedness $R$ is defined as the recursion (p. 354):
$$ R' = \frac{1}{N} + \frac{N-1}{N}s^2R$$
where $N$ is the number of individuals in each patch and $s$ is the probability the offspring will remain on the natal patch (<a href=""http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/35441/altruism-in-viscous-asexual-populations"">link to a question about $s$</a>). Here $R$ doesn't seem to be a measure of positive assortment, but simply the chance that two alleles picked <em>at random</em> within the patch will be of the same type.</p>

<p>On one hand, $R$ in standard models of kin selection (e.g., Queller's) measures positive assortment. On the other hand, Taylor's kin selection model for patch-structured populations $R$ does not seem to measure positive assortment within a group but the chance that two random individuals share the same allele. </p>

<p>I tended to think of Queller's model as a general formulation of kin selection (accordingly, Taylor's model would be a particular instance of Queller's model). But, as I tried to explain above, my impression is that Taylor's model is an entirely different way of modeling kin selection ($R$ does not measure positive assortment). Am I missing some connection between Queller's and Taylor's models of kin selection? Or is there any way of connecting the two definitions of relatedness mentioned above?</p>

"Why are there different species of bacteria? <p>The usual (high school or intro to bio) explanation for diversification of species comes from multicellular, usually sexually reproducing organisms, and seems to be closely tied to the biological species concept.

"Why do horses recycle their endometrial lining while humans don't? <p>How does not recycling the endometrial lining of the uterus benefit humans (and other organisms that menstruate), while recycling it is beneficial to horses (and other organisms that undergo estrus cycle)?</p>

<p>So the question linked by user137 gave me some useful points to work from. Bear with me though, because I learned alot of new jargon just by reading it.</p>

<p><strong>Helps immunity:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>""forces loose not only the endometrial lining but sperm-borne pathogens contained therein.""</p></li>
<li><p>""menstruation delivers immune cells to the uterine cavity, triggered by the mechanical pressure exerted via the shedding of endometrial lining.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Energy efficient:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>its simply more energy efficient to shed. saving 6 days worth of food per 4 cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>for individuals/species with high fecundability shedding of the lining is less useful</p></li>
<li><p>larger uterus = increased likelihood of menstrual shedding (from the answer I learned humans have a larger uterus -- relative to body size -- compared with other mammals who don't shed.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Miscarriage discardation?:</strong></p>

<p>the comment section also had an interesting reason saying that sloughing off the lining regularly helps get rid of dead embryos. </p>

<p>All of this is very useful and interesting but I'm still confused as to why horses don't shed. I would think horses have low fecundability since their awkward bodies would make it hard to mate. And if shedding the lining is more energy conservant, then why don't horses? I want to know why it is evolutionarily better for horses to fully reabsorb, compared to humans?</p>

"Critical pO2 threshold for cell division? <p>I'm a physicist asking questions on an aspect of cellular metabolism, so excuse my biological ignorance!

"A program for cell motility assessment with a batch process function? <p>Cell motility assessment is a branch of experimental biology or medical science. One example could be an assessment of treatment effects on sperm motility of an animal. The standard procedure involves taking film clips of sperm (or any other moving objects) through a microscope and measuring average linear velocity of particles on these film clips.

<p>The scalars $G,P$ represent the number of genotypes and traits, respectively.

I want to know how the average value of each of the phenotypic traits changes over time, suggesting I should use quantitative genetics theory and formulate the equation</p>

<p>$\Delta \bar{\boldsymbol{z}} = \mathbf{G}\mathbf{P}^{-1}\mathbf{s}$,</p>

"Well to well variation in thermal cycler fluorescence? <p>We have an old BioRad ICycler Thermal Cycler with MyIQ single color fluorescent detector. While it's meant for RT-PCR, we've been using it for melt curves and binding assays for different types of RNA using thiazole orange as the intercalating fluorophore. However, when we tried to get serious about this assay and do things in triplicate we noticed that the well to well variation was terrible, making statistical significance difficult to get.</p>

<p>After reading through the manual I tried to get ""persistent well factors"" for the instrument to correct for this variation. However, the instrument's protocol for this requires heating to 95⁰C, so intercalating fluorophores won't work, the RNA melts and fluorescence is lost, so I tried with fluorescein. This didn't solve the variation.</p>

<p>So I tried to make my own well factors by making 10mL of Poly(rA) Poly(rU) RNA solution with thiazole orange and filling 96 PCR tubes with 100µL each and measuring fluorescence. Then I calculate the average fluorescence and divided the average by the value for each well to determine a factor, F, for each well. Then I tried to normalize subsequent experiments by multiplying each well's fluorescence by its F to get a corrected value. However, while this reduces the variation a little, it's still pretty bad.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions to reduce the well to well variation in these experiments or otherwise correct the data?</p>

<p>I have no prior experience with RT-PCR instruments, everything I know about it comes from playing around with the instrument. I don't know if I'm missing something really basic. <br><br></p>

<p><strong>Step by step protocol</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Prepared 1xSSC buffer, 150mM NaCl, 15mM Sodium Citrate, pH 7.5</li>
<li>Weighed 5mg Thiazole Orange, dissolved in 1mL Methanol</li>
<li>Diluted Thiazole Orange 1000 fold in 1xSSC</li>
<li>Took 71.4µL (100µg) Poly(rU) Poly(rA) solution, 1.4µg/uL</li>
<li>Diluted RNA with 8.93mL 1xSSC</li>
<li>Added 100µL diluted Thiazole Orange to diluted RNA, final volume 10mL</li>
<li>Set up 96 PCR tubes, used 8 channel pipette and trough to transfer
100µL RNA solution to each</li>
<li>Placed PCR tubes in all 96 positions of thermal cycler</li>
<li>Ran melt curve protocol, start at 25⁰C, increase 1⁰C every cycle,
60 cycles, so final temp is 85⁰C. Each cycle is 10 seconds. 
Measure fluorescence every cycle.</li>
<li>Repeated melt curve 3 times, total of 4 curves.</li>
<li>Put data from each curve into spreadsheet. 96 data points at each temperature. </li>
<li>Averaged fluorescence across the whole plate at each temperature.
Used this average, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum 
values to make the plots below.</li>
<li>Calculated correction factors for each well at each temperature by 
dividing the whole plate average fluorescence by each well's 
fluorescence for melt curves 2, 3, and 4. Averaged correction factors from each curve.</li>
<li>Calculated corrected fluorescence for curves 1, 2, 3, and 4 by 
multiplying the averaged correction factor for each well by the 
observed fluorescence for that well.</li>
<li>Replotted the corrected values to show reduced variation.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Data is shown below. I repeated the melt curve 4 times because the first melt usually has a lower intensity than subsequent melts. Y axis is fluorescence, X axis is temperature in celsius, and I plotted the average fluorescence at each temperature with the standard deviation along with the minimum and maximum to show how far outside the standard deviation some wells are falling. I calculated the correction factors for melt curves 2, 3, and 4 and averaged them. When I used these averaged factors on melt curves 2, 3, and 4 it did a good job at eliminating variation. When I applied the correction factors to melt curve 1, it reduced the variation, but not by much.</p>

"Why doesn't Manipulated Virus for Cancer Cure Work <p>I'm not a biologist but I have an idea for a cure for cancer and it is very simple and probably has flaws (if it worked it probrably wouldn't be a cure for all) or is not possible but ... I'm still going to ask why because I want to learn why it doesn't work and I want to learn more in general, so you can use all the biology terms you like. The idea is essentially to use a virus and manipulate/change it (this would be mechanized if it were to be mass produced and the type of virus is unknown to me because you want one that is fast growing and goes across only specific parts of the body depending on the cancer). This virus would not have any bad parts (parts that make you sick) to it because when the virus ""injects"" it's DNA or manipulates the existing for copying it would instead manipulate the DNA in the cell it is going into to have growth limits and other cancer genes that are set to being back to normal and then copy itself. Eventually it would be fought off by the immune system and most of the virus would be gone (along with the cancer) because this virus would last for a long period of time (week(s)).</p>

<p>My solution:</p>

<p>$$\text{glucose} + \ce{O_2} + \text{fat} + x \, \ce{O_2 \rightarrow} \ce{CO_2} + 0.7x \, \ce{CO_2} \, + \ce{H2O}$$</p>

<p>Note that I haven't balanced the equation excepted for $\ce{O_2}$ and $\ce{CO_2}$ where I added coefficients based on the given RQ. This equation gives $$\text{RC}_{total}=\frac{1+0.7x}{1+x} = 0.85$$</p>

I would like to put these data in a table in which each row corresponds to a different drug.</p>

<p>For example, a row in the table might read (column names are indicated in brackets): [disease] breast cancer, [drug] trastuzumab, [drug target] HER2/neu receptor, [gene] ERBB2, [location] chr17:37844393-37884915, [mutation type] amplification, [accession number] ENSG00000141736. The pathologists would then be able to use this database in order to select appropriate genes for sequencing whenever they receive a tumor specimen. If the patient’s tumor had an amplified ERBB2 gene, they could be given trastuzumab.</p>

<p>Currently our study is in pre-planning stages (i.e., we won’t actually be testing this on patients any time soon). I would appreciate it if anyone could give me on advice on how to go about creating such a database.

<p>Lo, pulling it out of the oven I see several tiny spots where the aluminum foil has been eaten away. The edges are black-ish, which suggests <a href=""http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Lasagna+battery"">galvanic corrosion</a>, what's commonly called a ""lasagna battery"" or ""lasagna cell"" - the results of 2 metals sandwiching a piece of food that is acidic.

"Cooking pizza in tiny gas oven with pizza stone <p>I currently have a <strong>tiny gas</strong> oven to cook with this summer and I like to cook a lot of pizzas, but I have always cooked them in standard electric home ovens.</p>

<p>I have been doing some reading <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/42406/neapolitan-pizza-in-a-regular-gas-oven"">here</a> and <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/20124/how-can-i-reliably-bake-pizza-with-no-temperature-control-or-pizza-stone"">here</a>, but I don't think I have enough information yet.</p>

<p>Typically, I cook the pizzas on a 15"" stone with store bought fresh dough and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven with stone for at least 30 min at 425 F</li>
<li>Put dough in for about 2 min by itself</li>
<li>Layer on toppings</li>
<li>Push back into oven for 10-15 minutes (depends on the oven)</li>

<p>My current oven will fit my 13"" pizza stone, has a single flame rod (whatever that's called) on the bottom that starts in the back and extends towards the front. I cannot see into the oven as I normally would to watch the browning of the crust.</p>

<ul>
<li>How long will the pizza take to cook at some temperature? (&lt;= 500 F)</li>
<li>Do I need to let the dough sit by itself in the oven?</li>

<li>Opening the door too much to check the pizza (I know gas fluctuates more)</li>
<li>Burning (one the SO references said 90 seconds to cook)</li>

"Effects of elevated storage temperature on bread quality <p>It's pretty well-known and scientifically established that rather cool temperatures are bad for bread: putting your bread in the refrigerator will tend to dry it out and accelerate chemical reactions in the starches that cause staling (as discussed, for example, in some answers to <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/61/15018"">this question</a>).  Freezing, on the other hand, stops some of those reactions and is a common method for maintaining bread quality for longer storage.  Regardless of quality issues, both types of cooling will help to prevent molding, so there are trade-offs.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>what happens when we store bread at <em>warmer</em> temperatures, say in the 90-130F range (about 35-55C)?</strong>  How will quality be affected?  Will the shelf-life be altered?  Are the effects only good, only bad, or mixed?  I'm particularly interested in short-term holding (less than a day) at elevated temperatures.</p>

<p>Also, are there any food safety issues raised by a practice like this (i.e., worse than bread storage at room temperature)?  Bread is not a particularly good growth medium for bacteria, but I imagine that <em>Bacillus cereus</em> or something might be at least a potential concern.</p>

<hr>

<p>[Background, for those who are curious: The reason I ask this question is because I sometimes need to store bread temporarily in a hot car.  The only bakery near me that I trust to make decent bread sometimes has ""day-old"" bread on sale for half price.  Their normal prices are, to my mind, excessively high; so if I can't buy their loaves for half-price, I usually just make bread myself.  Occasionally, I'll pick up some loaves on the way to work, but it's inconvenient to take them back home immediately.  And while I have sometimes carried them into work with me, it would be easier to just leave them in my car.  I also can't pick up the bread on the way home, because the half-price bread (when they have it) generally sells out by mid-morning.  Although I can sometimes park under a tree or something, the reality is that the summer sun will often raise the temperature of my car interior to above 100F.  Thus, the bread will be subjected to quite a few hours of elevated temperatures.  I've done this once or twice without a major change in quality, but I'm wondering if there are benefits to justify the inconvenience of keeping it near room temperature.]</p>

<li>It seems to be well established that different types of tea should be prepared at different temperatures - black tea and fruit infusions with boiling water, green tea at 80 degrees centigrade, and so forth. Where/when was this established? How do we know it's optimal for each tea?</li>
<li>Likewise, durations to steep tea seem fairly well established. Is there any research on this? People seem a bit fuzzier on this than on temperatures, with some variation.</li>
<li>There's a lot of variance on the amount of tea leaves per litre of tea, varying between 2 grams per cup (8 grams per litre) and 15 grams per litre! Obviously, this depends on how finely cut the tea is, too. Is there any way I can determine this more objectively than just trying different amounts and tasting?</li>
<li>There seem to be several theories on how best to prepare iced tea. Some suggest using more tea and steeping for longer, some suggest preparing it cold, and so forth. Has anyone determined objectively which are better?</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize this my come across as rather pedantic, but given the huge variation in preparation suggestions, I'm interested in trying to figure out which work best. Most of the questions above could be answered to some degree, too, with an explanation of what it is - chemically - that makes one batch of tea better or worse, providing a foundation for making these sort of decisions.</p>

"Urad dal used whole in thoran/rasam - how to correctly prepare? <p>South indian recipes often seem to call for adding dry/rinsed raw urad dal (or even bigger pulses) straight into the oil with the spices at the beginning, or adding them into a tadka that is added later .. as expected, naively following that advice often leaves some or all of them very hard/crunchy/sometimes inedible in the finished dish. Is there a soaking/parboiling method that should be used and that recipe writers tend to assume you know to employ, and/or are there rules of thumb how the dish being cooked must/must not be treated after adding the raw dal or tadka to avoid such errors?</p>

"Are bubbling preserved lemons a sign of spoilage? <p>I recently made preserved lemons using a recipe from <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007SGM160"" rel=""nofollow"">Jerusalem: The Cookbook</a>. Having poked around a variety of recipes online, it's pretty much the same as all the rest: Lots of salt, squeeze out the juice, fill up the container with more fresh juice, add some rosemary and a red pepper. Float a little oil on top. Let sit in a cool, dark place for 30 days.</p>

<p>I opened the lemons last night, and a considerable amount of gas escaped from the lemon juice, which bubbled for about 2-3 minutes before calming down. The cap on the jar wasn't distended, and the mixture wasn't malodorous in any way. My instinct is to say, ""This is bad; throw this away"", but I haven't canned anything before so I'm not sure what to expect.

"What does tin foil do when baking a pot pie? <p>If you buy a pot pie at the store, the cooking instructions say to fold a strip of tinfoil around the edge before putting it in the oven.  I've seen what happens if I forget to do this: the edge gets all burned.  Apparently the foil helps keep some of the heat off.</p>

<p>Something strange happened to a friend of mine a while ago, though: she had never made one of these before, and she misread the instructions and put a sheet of tinfoil over the entire top of the pie.  It turned into a bit of a mess; after baking, <em>the whole thing</em> was only about half cooked!</p>

<p>That makes me wonder: what exactly is the foil doing?  It's nice and shiny, and if this were being cooked under a really powerful heat lamp I could understand how it would reflect a lot of the light away, but this is a conventional oven.  Heat is transferred from the air into the food by convection, and aluminum is a very good conductor of heat, so intuitively I'd think it would do practically nothing at all to keep the heat off.  But clearly it's actually being very effective, so what's going on?</p>

"Why isn't my steak fat cooking? <p>Recently, I've been experimenting with trying to cook steak on the stovetop (or in the oven), and I'm having a problem with each one that is really frustrating me. Typically when fat is left in a steak, its white and moist, while seeming to have at least partially rendered. In each steak I've cooked however, there remains chunks of solid, uncooked fat that ruins the dish. They are cold and hard and persistent throughout the cut, as if they hadn't been melted away at all. Its not the typical type of fat one sees remaining in a cooked steak. My question then is, what is happening and how do I avoid it? I've tried broiling and cooking over as high of heat as I can, and I've tried slow-roasting on medium heat for awhile. Is this ""fat"" mostly a consequence of cook time or temperature, and how can I fix it without obliterating my steak to shoe-leather town.</p>

<p>I should also mention that the steak is cooked past my liking (IE to medium-well) and there are pieces that have none of this fat so it seems like another culprit might be that I'm not cooking it evenly but I don't know what to do differently. </p>

"Thawed shrimp floating vs. sinking <p>I bought two 2-pound bags of frozen 41-50 count/pound shrimp. When I thawed them in cold water, one bag's shrimp all sank and the other bag's shrimp all floated.</p>

<pre><code>           Bag 1          Bag 2
buoyancy   sink           float
color      more white     slightly brownish
rinsing    clear          frothy
marking    66H/15TT/976   668/21TT/0H354

"Are there any tricks to making a light-textured ""whipped cream cake""? <p>During a web search, I found a cake recipe that uses heavy cream instead of butter. </p>

<p>However, when I made it, the cake texture was terrible; thick and doughy even though I tested the cake with a toothpick and the toothpick came out clean.This is the recipe I used:</p>

<pre><code>2 cups cake flour 
2 teaspoons baking powder
dash salt 
1 1/2 cups heavy cream 
1 1/3 cups white sugar 
2 eggs (room temperature) 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</code></pre>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 2 8"" cake pans; line with parchment paper; grease again.</p>

<p>Sift cake flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
Using an electric mixer, whisk the cream with the sugar until stiff peaks form. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well after the first before adding the second. Stir in the vanilla. Fold in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool cakes in pans for 10 minutes, then invert on to cooling racks; re-invert so that the tops of the cakes are facing upwards. Cool completely.</p>

<p>I live in Boulder County, Colorado, so I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cups (I do this routinely, eve when I lived in southern Indiana, because I believe excessive amounts of sugar are used in American baked goods (leavened without yeast).</p>

Are there adjustments that should be made to the recipe, such as increasing the baking temperature? I understand that this type of cake should have a velvety, melt-in-your-mouth texture.

"How to cook grass-fed, high-fat hamburger on electric stove? <p>I've managed, through trial-and-error, to learn how to cook regular hamburgers on an electric stove. But recently, I've switched to grass-fed beef (with 25% fat, higher than regular hamburgers), with less-than-stellar results. So, given these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An <strong>Electric</strong> stove (Yes, although every cooking book I've seen, thinks you should be cooking with gas - my apartment has an electric stove, so that's what I use.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.grasslandbeef.com/Detail.bok?no=525"" rel=""nofollow"">U.S. Wellness Meats grass-fed, 75% lean burgers</a>. These are <strong>pre-formed</strong>, and <strong>25% fat</strong>, which is higher than the standard burgers I used to cook. I'm sure the fat content affects cooking - I'm just not sure how.</p></li>
<li><p>12"" Calphalon non-stick skillet (although I'm wondering if I should replace it, that's a separate issue).</p></li>
<li><p>Infrared thermometer - very nice tool, I can't imagine not having one after using it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I want to know, is how, using <strong>only</strong> these resources, to cook a burger that is at least medium-well, if not well-done. So far, I've generally managed to get the outside too cooked, or the inside too pink.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate detailed, step-by-step instructions, if anyone has them. Even the so-called <em>basic</em> cookbooks seem to give just one-liners, for things like hamburgers.</p>

<p>For instance, one situation I don't know what to do about - after about a minute, the burger starts to bow up, so the underside isn't touching the skillet. It's obviously not getting cooked, so now what? I've seen posts saying you shouldn't press down grass-fed burgers. Most of the time, I'll flip it after a minute, so it's flatter. Is that a good method? I have no idea.</p>

<p>Or they say ""cook on medium-high heat"". Well, my <em>electric</em> stove doesn't have a medium-high setting, it has numbers 1-6. Give me a specific temperature (say, 350F), and I'll use the infrared thermometer to find it.</p>

<p>Update: yes, the hamburgers have thawed out in the refrigerator for a day, and I usually set them out while the stove is heating up. I also have an internal thermometer. As for using an oven - I'd <em>prefer</em> to use only the listed resources (with a skillet), rather than extra items (don't have a cast-iron skillet, don't want to cleanup a baking dish). If there is no other way to cook them well, I'd go with the oven, but I'd rather not.</p>

"Baking 'Master' Recipes <p>I have a question for the seasoned bakers out there. In a nutshell, I'm wondering if there are 'master' recipes for cakes, muffins, etc. Perhaps it's a little bit complicated, but here goes the explanation...</p>

<p>In bread baking, as I understand it, it's all about the hydration when it comes to the actual recipe.</p>

Flour | 100
Water | 66
Salt  | 2
Yeast | 1

<p>Varying the amount of water in the recipe (along with some other factors, of course--in preparation, for instance) will yield different types of bread.

I got to thinking, though, that perhaps there are recipes for cakes and whatnot that are 'master' recipes. Cakes have some general guidelines, for instance.</p>

"Cookie Biscuits: What happened? <p>My wife made some chocolate chip cookies tonight using the same recipe she has for years; it's the one on the back of the Tollhouse Chocolate Chips bag. The only modification she makes to the recipe is that she uses half the butter, which ends up being only a half cup instead of a whole. Usually the cookies turn out round, flat, and about 1 cm high, but tonight we discovered a surprise. These are around an inch high and weren't completely cooked through the center as seen below.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ayCNQ.jpg"" alt=""Biscuit cookies""></p>

<p>Both of us being engineers, we are curious as to why this happened. We used the following steps and ingredients when making them:</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2.25 Cups of Pillsbury all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda</li>
<li>1 tsp Morten salt</li>
<li>1 stick softened Fleichmanns original butter (normally uses Land-O-Lakes) (113g pure butter)</li>
<li>3/4 cup white sugar </li>
<li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 cups Tollhouse Semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation steps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Preheated the oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
<li>Whisked together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl</li>
<li>Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla with mixer until creamy.</li>
<li>Added eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
<li>Gradually beat in the flour mixture</li>
<li>Stirred in the chocolate chips</li>
<li>Dropped dough balls in place on a cookie sheet. </li>
<li>Cook for 9-11 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>The above steps are exactly what my wife did when we made these cookies. We noticed that the dough looked incredibly dense, sticky, and was very hard to mix after it was all combined. We used a mixer instead of hand mixing the dough like she has in the past, but I find it hard to believe that this would be the culprit (someone may very well prove the cooking n00b wrong though).</p>

<p>FWIW, please don't critique the recipe ;), as we really only want to know why they came out as biscuits when my wife has used this recipe exactly and successfully in the past. She has followed the same routine every time she has made them except for the use of a mixer and different brands of ingredients.</p>

In the end it tasted very aromatic as if he boiled away the alcohol from a whole bottle of wine and added the remaining grape essence to the pasta. </p>

<p>I tried the same process I cooked the vegetables, occasionally adding a spoon of white wine then added meat and whenever the pot was hot enough to boil a spoon of wine instantaneously I added a spoonful of wine again. I preferred this method because I did not have a wok pot and strong enough fire. In the end I ended up using a cup of white wine which gave little to no taste to the food at all.</p>

<p>So what am I doing wrong, is it the choice of wine that makes the dish very aromatic or choice of cooking method?</p>

<p>Update: After alot of tries I have seen that Moscato wine gives the most flavor to the food as the wine itself is very aromatic and sweet. For two portions of food I use one glass of it and a spoon of balsamic vinegar to balance the sweetness. In spanish dishes it is also used for bean and meat stews which I have also seen to be very nice.</p>

"Are vegetable (or coconut) oils more common used for frying and cooking than extra olive oil or it is a myth? <p>People suggest to use coconut or other vegetable oils (e.g. Sunflower oil) for frying and cooking, because heat destroys the oil where toxicological relevant compounds are formed, but it seems that Olive oil has higher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point"" rel=""nofollow"">smoking point</a> (which are 191-242°C/375-468°F, high-quality extra-virgin olive oils have a lower smoke point than lighter, highly-processed olive oils) than Coconut oil (e.g. Dry Unrefined has 177°C/350°F) which doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>At <a href=""http://www.truthinoliveoil.com/2013/10/science-cooking-olive-oil"" rel=""nofollow"">The science of cooking with olive oil</a> article we can read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High quality extra virgin olive oil can be heated to 420°F before it
  reaches smoke-point (ie begins to smoke and starts to form unhealthy
  compounds), which is higher than nearly every other vegetable oil. 
  Olive oil is much more stable when heated compared to most vegetable
  oil (1, 2).  Cooking with olive oil below the smoke-point does not
  destroy most of its health benefits, or make it less healthy – under
  normal cooking conditions, most of the therapeutic minor components
  are retained (3-5).  Some studies have subjected olive oil to high
  temperatures (180°C/356°F) for long periods of time (from 90 minutes
  to over 20 hours).</p>

"I'm tweaking a Lasagna Bolognese <p>I'm using fresh pasta sheets (boiled al dente), a very slow simmered Bolognese, a whole milk ricotta mixture with a fair amount of spinach, basil, egg and Parmesan and a Bechamel sauce. The thing is, I want six layers of pasta but I don't want a huge pan of lasagna. I'm making this for a (obviously very hot) date. I don't need leftovers into the next millennium. I think I'm going to use my 9"" pullman loaf pan (4x4x9 with a lid). I plan to butter the pan then line it with three parchment ""slings"", maybe one half of an inch between the strips of parchment for slicing. Get it? To make it easier to remove clean slices? After lining the pan with my ""slings"" I'll butter again then line the pan with Bechamel, then stack the layers. I'm thinking that I will use the pullman pan lid instead of aluminum foil for the initial bake. I will assemble the lasagne the night before and keep it refrigerated it until the next day. </p>

<p>So here's the question. I've looked at a gazillion recipes for clues about baking temperature, when to remove the lid and what temp to finish. Also whether to bring it to room temp before baking.

"Is copper cookware really better than stainless steel? <p>This is somewhat related to the question about <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/529/41"">copper vs. cast iron</a>, but this is about copper vs. pure stainless steel.</p>

<p>I had an old stainless steel stockpot that warped (it was very, very cheap stainless steel, paper thin) and have to replace it ASAP.  I have a family member with a few connections that gets a deep discount on one of the more expensive brands.  I asked her to look into getting me a copper stockpot (lined with stainless steel, of course, so the reactivity problem more or less goes away), and got this response as an explanation to why it is apparently unavailable here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] there is apparently no advantage cooking-wise to using copper, and people just buy it for the look.</p>
  
  <p>[...] None of our big accounts, including [XYZ] etc even had any interest in stocking it, which is why we never brought it in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that these stores do carry the same brand of stainless steel products, just not copper.</p>

<p>Now, I am taking this with a <del>grain</del> <strong>pile</strong> of salt because (a) this family member never cooks and (b) the advice came from a marketing manager who obviously wants to push the products that are available locally.  Nevertheless, I think it's worth asking people with knowledge/experience:</p>

<p><strong>Is there actual evidence confirming any of the advantages of copper cookware (durability, conductivity, heat spread, etc.)?  Has it actually been proven anywhere that copper is (or is not) superior to stainless steel?</strong></p>

<p>Or are <a href=""http://www.articlealley.com/article_652599_26.html"">articles</a> like <a href=""http://www.cheftalk.com/cooking_articles/cookware/236-The_Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Copper_Cookware.html"">these</a> just parroting a bunch of myths?</p>

<p>I'm looking for <em>strong evidence</em> here, so please answer only if you are prepared to back it up.</p>

<p><em><strong>Clarification</strong> (with apologies to Ward): I am looking for evidence of the <strong>practical</strong> benefits.  It's obviously indisputable and easy to look up the fact that copper is a better conductor than steel, and lighter; the question is, does this matter with respect to responsiveness, hot spots, and so on?</em></p>

The package (Carmen Creek) says ""cook slightly less than regular hamburgers"" - but since I'm not a cook, and have no real idea how to cook hamburgers, that's not so useful :) It also says, ""cook 3 minutes per side at 160 degrees"".</p>

<p>I have a Tappan electric stove with dials that have settings of 2-6/hi/low/, and a Calphalon 12'' pan of some sort (the edges are angled).</p>

<p>So, how exactly do you <em>determine</em> which number is 160 degrees? :) I've tried various settings, and have yet to get burgers that look right, they're either too rare, or mushy and fall apart when I remove them from the pan. Or maybe that's how bison burgers just are? How can I tell when they are cooked correctly?</p>

"'Sweet milk' substitute in an old recipe <p>I have an old pancake recipe (circa 1930) that I would like to try. However it includes as an ingredient ""sweet milk."" Having never seen such a thing in stores I'm trying to find the best substitute for this ingredient. </p>

<p>Given that the ""milk"" readily available in the 1930s was probably much fresher and full fat (and perhaps unpasteurized), I'm thinking that the best modern substitute would probably be whole milk or perhaps half-and-half. Would this be the correct ingredient substitution to make? And would a 1:1 ratio be acceptable?</p>

"How to scale chicken recipe that requires cooking in a single layer? <p>There's one adapted recipe I like a lot, but I've been struggling with how to make it scale better so I can double the recipe to make more leftovers/feed more people. The basic technique is to cook chicken breast tenders uncovered over medium/medium-high heat in oil and balsamic vinegar (and dry spices), adding some apricot preserves about halfway through. So in the end you end up reducing the sauce into an balsamic apricot glaze/sauce, and the chicken having marinated the whole time in the sauce imparting flavor on the chicken compared to making the sauce in a saucepan and adding after the chicken is cooked. </p>

<p>But in order for the chicken to cook evenly and well, the chicken needs to be laid out in a single layer in the pan, which is a bit of a limiting factor in how much chicken I can fit in the largest pan we own. Short of just making it in multiple batches, are there ways I could modify the preparation technique to come up with fairly similar tasting chicken, but in a way that I could scale the quantities larger? Would baking the chicken in the marinade achieve a similar result? Cook the sauce first, and pour over the raw chicken that's not in a single layer in a pan with the lid on? Something else?</p>

<p>Now I did this with dutch ovens when I would go camping as a kid.  I loved it because cleanup was just that much easier (no soaping).</p>

<p>But it has always confused me how this works.  How does the seasoning on stone ware pans and a dutch oven combat bacteria?</p>

<p>Or is soap just overrated?  Can I really just give all my pots an pans a good scraping and then rinse under hot water?  (Bacteria bactsheria, like it will hurt me.)</p>

<p>Or, is my wife wrong?  When we cook off those pans next time, am I enjoying a smorgasbord of bacterial offerings?  (Mmmm, love eating that aged bacteria!)  NOTE: I have never gotten sick from my wife's cooking.</p>

"What determines total heat when using chilis? Quantity × intensity? <p>I recently tried a bite of a Bhut/Naga Jolokia pepper, which is rated to be 3-10 times hotter than a ""standard"" habanero.  It was hot, but the total experience was not worse than a habanero, and definitely not worse than Buffalo Wild Wings' ""Blazin' Challenge,"" which is more about the volume of hot wing sauce you can consume.</p>

<p>Granted, my peppers were farmed in California, not India, but they should be well within an order of magnitude of its variety's rating.</p>

<p>Given the wide range of chili varieties and heat levels, I'm wondering how best to harness the heat of each.</p>

<ol>
<li>What determines the intensity and mouth location of a raw chili pepper experience?</li>
<li>Most of the capsaicin is contained in the pith and seeds, so is it a matter of how well you chew that portion and move it around in your mouth?</li>
<li>Are there other chemical factors at work in each pepper that affect the release/reception of the capsaicin?</li>
<li>When cooked down, is it just a simple equation of <code>pepper volume × Scoville rating</code>?</li>
<li>Is a large fruit likely to contain more capsaicin than a small fruit, or about the same?</li>
<li>Since Thai chilis are around 75,000 SHU, are they 7 times hotter <em>per volume</em> than Serranos at 10,000 SHU?</li>

"How do I make black rice turn out better in a rice cooker? <p>There appears to be little to no info out there specifically regarding black rice and rice cookers. My rice cooker manual says nothing about it. The article on wikihow, ""<a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Prepare-Black-Rice"" rel=""nofollow"">3 Ways to Prepare Black Rice</a>"", does mention that black rice ""does not cook well in a rice cooker."" But, I am simply not willing to cook rice the old fashioned way. I already spend too much time on eating and cooking (fast metabolism means I eat all the time, which is time consuming). </p>

<p>Therefore, even if it does not work <em>well</em> in a rice cooker, I need to figure out how to make it <em>better</em>. I recently got a new rice cooker, an Aroma ARC-150SB. I made black rice for the first time with it, and it was terrible. It was <em>really</em> mushy, watery, and very sticky. It looked almost as wet as below:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gttx7.jpg"" alt=""http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/images/rice-pudding.jpg""></p>

<p>(That's just an image from some pudding recipe on another site; it's NOT my own photo.)</p>

<p>Further details: I used 2 parts water to 1 part rice, as told to do on the rice packaging. Specifically, it was 2 cups rice, 4 of water. I briefly rinsed the rice via a strainer with cold water from the faucet. I used the ""brown rice"" setting on my rice cooker and left it overnight. (It switches to ""keep warm"" after it finishes cooking, of course.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, what is the explanation for my result, and what can I try next? </p>

<p>My suspicion is that there was a lot of starch. The wikihow article suggests a very thorough rinsing, although the instructions on the rice packaging say nothing about rinsing. Is thorough rinsing really all it takes? Like I said, I did rinse it a little. There are other variables here that I can change. I could try playing with the water:rice ratio. I could try to not leave it overnight. I could try the white rice cook setting?? Although that one sounds counterintuitive. Maybe a thorough rinsing AND a different water:rice ratio is necessary? </p>

"How to determine perfect pan temperature for steak? <p>I have an electric stove that makes it hard to adjust temperature rapidly. I normally cook steaks in cast iron pan which I put on the biggest stove circle, with the highest setting of 12.

"How do I hand-roll homemade pasta made with egg? <p>I have a very simple recipe for homemade pasta dough (one egg to 100g flour, some oil), and found this worked great on my first small batch. I mixed it in a stand mixer and immediately rolled it out, using lots of flour to keep things from sticking. It was a bit thick, but I chalk that up to inexperience.</p>

<p>On my second batch I made slightly more dough and split it into four balls before rolling each one out. The first two I rolled out almost right away, cut and shaped the pasta, and threw on a plate with some flour until I got around to cooking it. </p>

<p>I left the last two balls of dough sitting for 30 minutes or more before I got to them, and these were much, <em>much</em> harder to roll out.

"separating almond flour from almond meal <p>I've been experimenting with almond flour for baking bread because I have a hard time digesting starches.  I've progressed to the point where my bread made from 50:50 (almond:wheat flours) is almost indistinguishable from 100% wheat flour.  That's a big win for me.</p>

<h2>Almond Meal is not Almond Flour</h2>

<p>The problem is that I have yet to find anyone actually selling actual almond flour.  Most vendors only sell almond meal even though they like to call it ""almond flour"".  Some vendors sell ""fine ground almond flour"" which is still just fine ground almond meal (I'm lookin' at you Bob's Red Mill).  Semantics aside, I have found that the fat content of almond products I can buy is too high and the texture too gritty to make good bread dough.</p>

<h2>Making Almond Flour from Almond Meal</h2>

<p>I've had great success separating the oily and gritty parts of almond meal from the almond flour.  With the right pitch of sieve you end up with surprisingly smooth and dry flour and a yield of between 65% and 80%.  </p>

<p>I'm fine with the yield.  The sifting process, however, is terribly slow.  Making 50 grams of flour with a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001VZERX4"" rel=""nofollow"">plain-old dome-shaped sieve</a> takes about 5 minutes of labour.  That's just too time consuming to become a regular part of my meals.</p>

<h2>Is there a better way?</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a method or device that will separate more flour from almond meal with less manual labour?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there some source of actual almond flour hidden away by food distributors somewhere?</p></li>

"How do I make dosas smooth and shiny? <p>I tried my hand at making dosas for the first time this weekend.</p>

<p>I was following <a href=""http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/masala-dosa-recipe-how-to-make-masala-dosa-recipe/"" rel=""nofollow"">this recipe</a> for the dosa batter.</p>

<p>I soaked the dal and fenugreek seeds together and the rice by itself. The rice and dal were then blended together. They were then fermented.</p>

<p>At this point real life happened and I didn't have time to actually make them. They fermented for two days. By this time the batter was very aerated and fragrant.</p>

<p>I then used non-stick spray on an electric griddle and cooked them similar to crepes- spreading them thin with the back of the ladle.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5CG1J.jpg"" alt=""Sambar and Dosa""></p>

<p>They were delicious! More sour and nutty than restaurant dosas but they had entirely the ""wrong"" texture. Where restaurant dosas are smooth, shiny, brown, and crisp; mine were much paler and, although they could get somewhat crisp, they were never smooth or shiny and didn't stay crisp for long.</p>

<p>Indian coworkers have told me that there are variations in traditional dosas and just one style is used in restaurants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a tradition style of dosa that ferments longer and is more sour?</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to perfect this recipe and make my dosas more like the restaurant style. Obviously the batter fermented far longer than required. That would account for the aeration, acidity, and minimal browning.</p>

<p>Is the fermentation also responsible for the lack of shine and crispness?</p>

<p>There are a few variables that could also come into play:  </p>

<li>Cooking on a griddle is not traditional (I think). Could the cooking temp be wrong?  </li>
<li>The pan is usually oiled with an onion dipped in oil. I used non-stick spray.  </li>
<li>I was unsure of the batter thickness.<br>
At one point I thinned it with water. This may be hard to answer, but what consistency should the batter be? Would thinner help?</li>

* 2 cups whole milk
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 8 oz. canned chopped green chiles, like Chile Ortegas, drained
* 1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped

* 2 tsp. olive oil
* 2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded, deveined, and finely chopped OR 1 to 2 canned chipotle chiles chopped
* 8 oz. monterey jack or asadero cheese, grated 
* salt to taste
* fresh ground pepper to taste

"What causes this Android APK Upload error: ""Non-upgradable APK"" <p>I have an Android APK in the Google Play store with an Target SDK of 23.</p>

<p>I have released a new version (same target SDK) and Google shows me this error:</p>

<p>If I proceed (I learnt the hard way) then none of the current users can upgrade to this version. I had to restore the code, increment the build number and rebuild the APK to ""rollback"" to a usable version.</p>

<p>However, I cannot work out WHY google is showing me this error. Note, the ""0 Supported Android Devices"" is a red-herring - it is a known issue in Google Play in the last 24 hours - if you publish the APK the real number of devices is shown. </p>

<p>Please give me some leads on what the difference is or what causes this error:</p>

<p><strong>Non-upgradable APK</strong>
WARNING
None of the users of this APK will be able to upgrade to any of the new APKs added in this release.
TIP
Ensure that all your new APKs are added to this release.

"Spark 2.0 deprecates 'DirectParquetOutputCommitter', how to live without it? <p>Recently we migrated from ""EMR on HDFS"" --> ""EMR on S3"" (EMRFS with consistent view enabled) and we realized the Spark 'SaveAsTable' (parquet format) writes to S3 were ~4x slower as compared to HDFS but we found a workaround of using the DirectParquetOutputCommitter -[1] w/ Spark 1.6.</p>

<p>Reason for S3 slowness - We had to pay the so called Parquet tax-[2] where the default output committer writes to a temporary table and renames it later where the rename operation in S3 is very expensive</p>

<p>Also we do understand the risk of using 'DirectParquetOutputCommitter' which is possibility of data corruption w/ speculative tasks enabled.</p>

<p>Now w/ Spark 2.0 this class has been deprecated and we're wondering what options do we have on the table so that we don't get to bear the ~4x slower writes when we upgrade to Spark 2.0. Any Thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>One workaround that we can think of is - Save on HDFS and then copy it to S3 via s3DistCp (any thoughts on how can this be done in sane way as our Hive metadata-store points to S3?)</p>

<p>Also looks like NetFlix has fixed this -[3], any idea on when they're planning to open source it?</p>

There are also binaries that can be downloaded <a href=""http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.9.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.9.0</a>. These do seem to contain libc++ but I'm not sure if I can just copy bits of this into places like /usr/include/c++/v1, in fact I'm not really sure what bits I would need to copy. I am aware I can use libc++ from an alternate location as documented here <a href=""http://libcxx.llvm.org/docs/UsingLibcxx.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://libcxx.llvm.org/docs/UsingLibcxx.html</a> which I have tried. However I can't modify the build system of the large code base I work on to do this.</p>

"How to fix null object that appears all the time on my phone and sometimes on my emulator got a probleme with Android studio. I'm trying to do a pretty simple app but on my phone (Galaxy S8) it always gives me the same error. And i use two computer it does the same at home and at school. When i use the emulator, i have the problem also on the emulator at home that is not the same from school but not in School.

So on the emulator at school, the one that works i had the same error as all the other place but juste once and ive tried it a lot of time. But later in the program i have the same kind of error that appears but in some other function. So far i havent been able to go past that.

The error is saying that im trying to do something on a null object (a layout or a text view). The error that happens always on my phone is as soon as i try to use a constraint layer it wont work. The other one that happens late in the program on the emulator seems really random. Its a game of card the 98 card game. And at some time when i try to drop a card on one of the pile it give me the null object error on the same textView. I have really tried but cant see any pattern on this one.

```
public Boolean checkEndOfGame(LinearLayout cartes, LinearLayout piles){
        if(nbCartes == 0){
            return true;
        }

                    for(int k=0; k< cartes.getChildCount(); k++){
                        LinearLayout rangee = (LinearLayout)cartes.getChildAt(i);

                            Integer noCarte = new Integer(texteCarte.getText().toString());
                            if(i>0){ //UP
                                if(noCarte>noPile){
                                    return false;
                                }
                            }else{ //DOWN
                                if(noCarte<noPile){
                                    return false;

"Docker Compose + Spring Boot + Postgres connection <p>I have a Java Spring Boot app which works with a Postgres database. I want to use Docker for both of them. I initially put just the Postgres in Docker, and I had a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>version: '2'
services:
    db:
        container_name: sample_db
        image: postgres:9.5
        volumes:

        ports:
            - 5432:5432

volumes:
    sample_db: {}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when I issued the commands <code>sudo dockerd</code> and <code>sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up</code>, it was starting the database. I could connect using <code>pgAdmin</code> for example, by using <code>localhost</code> as server and port <code>5432</code>. Then, in my Spring Boot app, inside the <code>application.properties</code> file I defined the following properties.</p>

<pre><code>spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sample
spring.datasource.username=sample
spring.datasource.password=sample
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I could run my Spring Boot app locally through Spring Suite, and it all was working fine. Then, I wanted to also add my Spring Boot app as Docker image. I first of all created a Dockerfile in my project directory, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>FROM java:8
EXPOSE 8080
ADD /target/manager.jar manager.jar
ENTRYPOINT [""java"",""-jar"",""manager.jar""]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I entered to the directory of the project issued <code>mvn clean</code> followed by <code>mvn install</code>. Next, issued <code>docker build -f Dockerfile -t manager .</code> followed by <code>docker tag 9c6b1e3f1d5e myuser/manager:latest</code> (the id is correct). Finally, I edited my existing <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>version: '2'
services:
    web:
      image: myuser/manager:latest
      ports: 
          - 8080:8080

</code></pre>

<p>But, now if I issue <code>sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up</code> command, the database again starts correctly, but I get errors and exit code 1 for the web app part. The problem is the connection string. I believe I have to change it to something else, but I don't know what it should be. I get the following error messages:</p>

Looks like mostly code, so added some random article:

It looks like your post is mostly code; please add some more details
An article (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation art) is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope.

The articles in English grammar are the and a/an, and in certain contexts some. ""An"" and ""a"" are modern forms of the Old English ""an"", which in Anglian dialects was the number ""one"" (compare ""on"" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number ""owan"". Both ""on"" (respelled ""one"" by the Norman language) and ""an"" survived into Modern English, with ""one"" used as the number and ""an"" (""a"", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.

In many languages, articles are a special part of speech which cannot be easily combined[clarification needed] with other parts of speech. In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, which contains articles, demonstratives (such as ""this"" and ""that""), possessive determiners (such as ""my"" and ""his""), and quantifiers (such as ""all"" and ""few"").[1] Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.[2]

In languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain definiteness, definite or indefinite, as an attribute (similar to the way many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number—singular or plural—or a grammatical gender). Articles are among the most common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most frequent word is the.[3]

Articles are usually categorized as either definite or indefinite.[4] A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type, languages may have various forms of each article, due to conforming to grammatical attributes such as gender, number, or case. Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in elision (e.g., French ""le"" becoming ""l'"" before a vowel), epenthesis (e.g., English ""a"" becoming ""an"" before a vowel), or contraction (e.g. Irish ""i + na"" becoming ""sna"").

"October CMS - How to correctly route <p>I've been reviewing the documentation for October CMS routing (<a href=""https://octobercms.com/docs/plugin/registration#routing-initialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://octobercms.com/docs/plugin/registration#routing-initialization</a>), but I think that I am missing something. I have a page called 'deals' that renders some basic information along with a plugin (called 'deals') component. The page normally appears at the url:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/deals
</code></pre>

<p>However, I want to create a route so that if someone visits the url:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/deals2

<p>it will automatically route them back to</p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/deals

<p>I know that I should create a routes.php file in my plugin directory. However, when I try using </p>

<pre><code>Route::get('/deals2', function()
{
        return View::make('deals');
});

<p>It complains that it can't find the 'deals' view. What am I doing wrong?</p>

"Use multiple var files in ansible role <p>One of my roles has two different variable types. One is public (things like package versions and other benign information). These can be committed to SCM without a worry. It also requires some private information (such as API keys and other secret information). I'm using <code>ansible-vault</code> to encrypt secret information. My solution was to have <code>vars/main.yaml</code> for pulic, and <code>vars/vault.yml</code> for the encrypted private information.</p>

<p>I came across a problem and am uncertain what's the best practice or actual solution here. It seems that ansible only loads the <code>vars/main.yml</code> file. Naturally I do not want to encrypt the public information so I looked for solution. So far the only solution I came up with (suggested on IRC) is to create <code>group_vars/all/vault.yml</code> and prefix all variables with the role name. This works because ansible seems to recursively load everything under <code>group_vars</code>. This does work but seems organizationally incorrect because the variables are for a <em>specific</em> role and not ""globally universally true"". I also tried to put <code>include: vars/vault.yml</code> into <code>vars/main.yml</code> but that did not work.</p>

"vuex- state returned as function or object literal <p>I ran into a problem the other day, and asked the great stack community for a solution. </p>

<h3>The problem:</h3>

<p>I nested the same module in other modules but I was defining state in this way:</p>

<pre><code>state: {
  // some state here
}
</code></pre>

<p>What was happening is all of my modules despite seeming being nested under disparate modules all shared the same state.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<pre><code>state() {
  return {
    // state here instead
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is to have a function return state rather than define it as an object literal. The why somewhat makes sense. Here are my questions</p>

<h3>New questions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>What is happening under the hood of the store when state is defined as an object literal versus a function returning an object literal?</p></li>

"Does Spark maintain parquet partitioning on read? <p>I am having a lot trouble finding the answer to this question. Let's say I write a dataframe to parquet and I use <code>repartition</code> combined with <code>partitionBy</code> to get a nicely partitioned parquet file. See Below:</p>

<pre><code>val df = spark.read.parquet(""/path/to/parquet/file"")

"How many Windows users have UTF-8 set as the code page? <p>In my understanding, the use of Windows filesystem functions accepting bytes (those with an <code>A</code> suffix) is discouraged (I didn’t find an official deprecation notice, but for example <a href=""https://bugs.python.org/issue13374"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python</a> deprecated their use).</p>

<p>On Unix-derived systems, file names are stored as bytes.  The encoding isn’t defined, but many systems are configured to interpret file names as UTF-8.</p>

<p>Since recently, it seems to be possible on Windows to set the code page to UTF-8.  Is it possible to estimate how many Windows users have that code page set?  Does it make sense to use the bytes-accepting filesystem API on Windows similar to how the POSIX API is used on Unix-derived systems (e.g. when porting some application from Linux to Windows)?</p>

"Using R with git and packrat <p>I have been using git for a while but just recently started using packrat. I would like my repository to be self contained but at the same time I do not want to include CRAN packages as they are available. It seems once R is opened in a project with packrat it will try to use packages from project library; if they are not available then it will try to install from src in the project library; if they are not available it will look at libraries installed in that computer. If a library is not available in the computer; would it look at CRAN next?</p>

"Inject character between substring of a string in Java <p>I have a list of words stored in a list, words.</p>

<p>I then have a string, helloWorld</p>

<p><code>private String helloWorld = ""Hello world how are you?"";</code></p>

<p>I would like to create a function that will take a string (in this case, helloWorld) and it will look case-insensitively to see if any of the strings in the <code>words</code> list are present. If there is, it will put a <code>*</code> character in between each letter of the matching string.</p>

"Linux driver: ioctl or sysfs? <p>I'm writing a driver to control some custom hardware.</p>

<p>In the old days (i.e. 15yrs ago) I was doing this with <code>ioctls</code>, but am now digging into <code>sysfs</code> as a possible alternative.</p>

<ul>
<li>As I understand it, ioctls aren't totally deprecated, but sysfs is preferred (?)</li>
<li>I need to read/write sets of values simultaneously i.e. through one sysfs entry. I've read that this isn't ideal, but is acceptable if necessary (?)</li>
<li>There needs to be '<code>mutex</code>' protection on the driver, so that only one app can write to it at a time. (I do have some read-only 'info' entries which I'd prefer to keep accessible to all at all times).</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the above, what would be the best way to proceed - ioctl or sysfs?</p>

<p>If sysfs, then how can I implement exclusive access? </p>

<p>If sysfs, then if the driver has no read/write/ioctl fops, does it need open/release?!</p>

<p>(This is a 'private' driver, so I don't care massively ;), but figured if the new ways are more applicable then I might as well get to grips with them!)</p>

"Python Asynchronous Comprehensions - how do they work? <p>I'm having trouble understanding the use of asynchronous comprehensions introduced in Python 3.6. As a disclaimer, I don't have a lot of experience dealing with asynchronous code in general in Python.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PEP</a>, this is expanded to:</p>

<pre><code>result = []
async for i in aiter():
    if i % 2:
        result.append(i)

<p>I <em>think</em> I understand that the <code>aiter()</code> function gets called asynchronously, so that each iteration of <code>aiter</code> can proceed without the previous one necessarily returning yet (or is this understanding wrong?).</p>

<p>What I'm not sure about is how that then translates to the list comprehension here. Do results get placed into the list in the order that they are returned? Or are there effective 'placeholders' in the final list so that each result is placed in the list in the right order? Or am I thinking about this the wrong way?</p>

<p>Additionally, is someone able to provide a real-world example that would illustrate both an applicable use case and the basic mechanics of <code>async</code> in comprehensions like this?</p>

"overwrite hive partitions using spark <p>I am working with AWS and I have workflows that use Spark and Hive. My data is partitioned by the date, so everyday I have a new partition in my S3 storage. 
My problem is when one day the load data fails and I have to re-execute that partition. The code that writes is next:</p>

<pre><code>df                            // My data in a Dataframe
  .write
  .format(getFormat(target))  // csv by default, but could be parquet, ORC...
  .mode(getSaveMode(""overwrite""))  // Append by default, but in future it should be Overwrite
  .partitionBy(partitionName) // Column of the partition, the date
  .options(target.options)    // header, separator...
  .option(""path"", target.path) // the path where it will be storage
  .saveAsTable(target.tableName)  // the table name
</code></pre>

<p>What happens in my flow? If I use the SaveMode.Overwrite, the complete table will be delete and I will have only the partition saved. If I use the SaveMode.Append I could have duplicate data. </p>

<p>Making a search, I found that Hive support this kind of overwrite, only partition, but using the hql sentences, I don´t have it.</p>

<p>We need the solution on Hive, so we can´t use this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38487667/overwrite-specific-partitions-in-spark-dataframe-write-method"">alternative option</a> (direct to csv).</p>

<p>I had found this <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20236"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jira ticket</a> that suppose to solve the problem that I´m having, but trying that with the last version of Spark (2.3.0), the situation was the same. It delete the whole table and save the partition instead of overwrite the partition that my data has.</p>

<p>Trying to make clearer this, this is an example:</p>

<p>Partitioned by A</p>

<p>Data: </p>

<pre><code>| A | B | C | 
|---|---|---| 
| b | 1 | 2 | 
| c | 1 | 2 |
</code></pre>

<p>Table:</p>

<pre><code>| A | B | C | 
|---|---|---| 
| a | 1 | 2 | 
| b | 5 | 2 | 
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is: In Table, the partition <code>a</code> stay in table, partition <code>b</code> overwrite with the Data, and add the partition <code>c</code>. Is there any solution using Spark that I can do this? </p>

<p>My last option to do this is first deleting the partition that is going to be saved and then use the SaveMode.Append, but I would try this in case no other solution.</p>

"Why doesn't F# Compile Currying into Separate Functions? <p>So I'm trying to learn F# and as I learn new things I like to look at the IL to see what's happening under the covers. I recently read about Currying, an obvious fundamental of the language. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/currying/"">F# for fun and Profit</a> when you create the below function:</p>

<pre><code>let addItems x y = x + y
</code></pre>

<p>What is really happening is there are two single argument functions being created.</p>

<pre><code>let addItems x =
    let subFunction y = 
          x + y
    subFunction
</code></pre>

<p>and when you invoke the function with addItems 5 6 the order of operations are as follows</p>

<ol>
<li><p>addItems is called with argument 5</p></li>
<li><p>addItems returns subFunction</p></li>
<li>subFunction is called with argument 6</li>
<li>subFunction has argument 5 in scope so it adds and returns the sum of 5 and 6</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this sounds fine on the surface. However, when you look at the IL for this it tells a different story. </p>

<pre><code>.method public static int32  testCurry(int32 x,
                                       int32 y) cil managed
{
  .custom instance void [FSharp.Core]Microsoft.FSharp.Core.CompilationArgumentCountsAttribute::.ctor(int32[]) = ( 01 00 02 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 ) 
  // Code size       5 (0x5)
  .maxstack  8

  IL_0001:  ldarg.0
  IL_0002:  ldarg.1
  IL_0003:  add
  IL_0004:  ret
} // end of method Sandbox::testCurry
</code></pre>

<p>We can clearly see in the IL that a single static function that takes two arguments and returns an Int32 is created. </p>

<p>So my question is, why the discrepancy? This isn't the first time I've seen IL that doesn't jive with the documentation either... </p>

"How to read a zip entry in a zip file, ad nauseum for c# or vb.net While there is a response to this question using the java libraries (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11287486/read-a-zip-file-inside-zip-file), I cannot find an example of this anywhere in c# or vb.net.

What I have to do for a client is use the .NET 4.5 ZipArchive library to traverse zip files for specific entries.  Before anyone asks, the client refuses to allow me to use dotnetzip, because his chief architect has experience with that library and says it is too buggy to be used in a real application.  He's pointed out a couple to me, and it doesn't matter what I think anyway!

If I have a zip file, that itself contains other zip files, I need a way of opening the inner zip files, and read the entries for that zip file.  Eventually I will also have to actually open the zip entry for the zip in a zip, but for now I just have to be able to get at the zipentries of an inner zip file.

Here's what I have so far:

    public string PassThruZipFilter(string[] sfilters, string sfile, bool buseregexp, bool bignorecase, List<ZipArchiveZipFile> alzips)
    {
      bool bpassed = true;
      bool bfound = false;
      bool berror = false;
      string spassed = """";
      int ifile = 0;
      try
      {
        ZipArchive oarchive = null; ;
        int izipfiles = 0;
        if (alzips.Count == 0)
        {
          oarchive = ZipFile.OpenRead(sfile);
          izipfiles = oarchive.Entries.Count;
        }
        else
        {
          //need to dig into zipfile n times in alzips[i] where n = alzips.Count
          oarchive = GetNthZipFileEntries(alzips, sfile); <------ NEED TO CREATE THIS FUNCTION!
          izipfiles = oarchive.Entries.Count;
        }
        while (((ifile < izipfiles) & (bfound == false)))
        {
          string sfilename = """";
          sfilename = oarchive.Entries[ifile].Name;
          //need to take into account zip files that contain zip files...
          bfound = PassThruFilter(sfilters, sfilename, buseregexp, bignorecase);
          if ((bfound == false) && (IsZipFile(sfilename)))
          {
            //add this to the zip stack
            ZipArchiveZipFile ozazp = new ZipArchiveZipFile(alzips.Count, sfile, sfilename);
            alzips.Add(ozazp);
            spassed = PassThruZipFilter(sfilters, sfilename, buseregexp, bignorecase, alzips);
            if (spassed.Equals(sISTRUE))
            {
              bfound = true;
            }
            else
            {
              if (spassed.Equals(sISFALSE))
              {
                bfound = false;
              }
              else
              {
                bfound = false;
                berror = true;
              }
            }
          }
          ifile += 1;
        }
      }
      catch (Exception oziperror)
      {
        berror = true;
        spassed = oziperror.Message;
      }
      if ((bfound == false))
      {
        bpassed = false;
      }
      else
      {
        bpassed = true;
      }
      if (berror == false)
      {
        spassed = bpassed.ToString();
      }
      return (spassed);
    }


So the function I have to create is 'GetNthZipFileEntries(List<ZipFileZipEntry>, sfile)', where the ZipFileZipEntry is just a structure that contains an int index, string szipfile, string szipentry.

I cannot figure out how read a zip file inside a zip file (or G-d forbid, a zip file inside a zip file inside a zip file...the 'PassThruZipFilter is a function **inside** a recursive function) using .NET 4.5.  Obviously microsoft does it, because you can open up a zip file inside a zip file in explorer.  Many thanks for anyone that can help.

**So, I truly need your help on how to open zip files inside of zip files in .NET 4.5 without writing to the disk**.  There are NO examples on the web I can find for this specific purpose.  I can find tons of examples for reading zip file entries, but that doesn't help. **To be clear, I cannot use a hard disk to write anything**.  I can use a memory stream, but that is the extent of what I can do.  **I cannot use the dotnetzip library**, so any comments using that won't help, but of course I'm thankful for any help at all.  I could use another library like the Sharp zip libs, but I'd have to convince the client that it is impossible with .NET 4.5.",4

"How to tell between undefined array elements and empty slots? <p>Suppose I am a user script developer and I don't have control over the on-page javascript. The page creates arrays with random lengths, filling them with random values (including falsy ones, such as <code>undefined</code>). Not every element has to be assigned a value, so there may be empty slots.</p>

<p>A simplified example (Firefox console):</p>

<pre><code>var arr = new Array(3);
arr[0] = null;
arr[1] = undefined;
console.log(arr);               \\ Array [ null, undefined, &lt;1 empty slot&gt; ]
console.log(arr[1]);            \\ undefined
console.log(arr[2]);            \\ undefined
console.log(arr[1] === arr[2]); \\ true
console.log(typeof arr[1]);     \\ undefined
console.log(typeof arr[2]);     \\ undefined
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, Firefox displays <code>undefined</code> and empty slots differently, whereas for javascript they seem to be identical.</p>

<p>Now suppose I want to clean such an array, removing all empty slots but leaving <code>undefined</code> elements intact. How do I do that?</p>

<p>The latter seems to be more correct. But it confuses me, I don't understand that how would it know that how much memory the array exists on. I mean, we are only giving it the starting address of the array(through p).

"Jenkins Pipeline: How to write UTF-8 files with writeFile? <p>I'm hoping this is not a bug and that I'm just doing something wrong. I have a Jenkins (v2.19.1) Pipeline job and in it's groovy script, I need to search and replace some text in an existing text file, on a Windows node.</p>

<p>I've used fart.exe and powershell to do the search and replace, but I would really like to do this with just the groovy in Jenkins and eliminate dependency on fart/powershell/etc. and make this code more reusable on both linux and windows nodes.</p>

<p>After much googling and trying various approaches, the closest I got was to use readFile and writeFile. However, I've not been able to get writeFile to create a UTF-8 file. It creates an ANSI file even when I specify UTF-8 (assuming I'm doing it correctly). </p>

<p>Here's what I have so far...</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>def fileContents = readFile file: ""test.txt"", encoding: ""UTF-8""
fileContents = fileContents.replace(""hello"", ""world"")
echo fileContents
writeFile file: ""test.txt"", text: fileContents, encoding: ""UTF-8""
</code></pre>

<p>I've confirmed with multiple text editors that the test.txt file is UTF-8 when I start, and ANSI after the writeFile line. I've tried all combinations of including/not-including the encoding property and ""utf-8"" vs ""UTF-8"". But in all cases, the file is written out as ANSI (as reported by both Notepad++ and VS Code). Also, a question mark (HEX 3F) is added as the very first character of the file. </p>

<p>The echo line does not show the extra 3F character, so it seems the issue is in the writeFile line.</p>

The bigger the code gets,the problem of very long namespaces and switch statements/if statements becomes annoying.

Is there a way I can tell the compiler to use the specific namespace during the run-time? Or Maybe by using a config variable or a string that has namespace path.

So instead of saying MyProject.A.bla.bla.bla.Deposit(), I just call Deposit() and the compiler, based on my predefined value, knows what namespace.

3-encrypt the contents of file(any cypher method)
------*note: the input file name has to be scanned during execution
I and my team have already made about 75% of it but it's in separate parts like each of the following three tasks is an individual program..and we are having trouble combining them.
Another error is that we are using ""rename"" function from files concept to copy files and change their format and we don't have any idea of how to use scanf to read the file name and give it as input to the rename function..
So if you could give me any suggestions..I'd really be grateful.",4
"too many errors in R program I have just started studying R in second sem of my undergrad. It is hard to figure out a lot of things here. I hope if you can point me in right direction?

initially i was not sure why require lines were giving error, then i figured they were trying to load packages which were not in my RStudio installation, so i got them on. I also figured that the data given to me was to be put in a file named auto_mpg.txt. But the errors after that line are hard to figure.

can you pl help me understand this?

ty.

"Angular2: Export of RouterModule, Why it is required? <p>I am learning <a href=""http://angular.io"" rel=""noreferrer"">Angular 2</a>'s  <a href=""https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html#app-routing"" rel=""noreferrer"">app-routing</a> from official documentation.

<p>It creates an <code>AppRoutingModule</code> and defines <code>routes</code> for it.

I am making a simple calculator app, there is a Button badd(button to perform addition) and an EditText e1. when this button is clicked; first it'll be checked if the textbox is empty or not if it is empty it'll display a Toast telling user to enter a number. if the number is already entered that number will be stored in a variable num1 and textbox will get empty so that user can input another number and addition will be performed on the two numbers.  
  
When i entered a number and pressed badd addition was done successfully. But my problem is that when i leave the edit text box empty (null) i get a runtime error and instead of displaying toast it shows an error ""your application is unfortunately closed"".  
  
I created a string variable s1 also that takes the string entered in e1 and concate that string with another string ""hi"" so that if the string is empty it'll at least display a hi message in log cat. It is to check if there is some error in anonymous inner class. but it is cleared that there is no problem the anonymous inner class and else block.  
  
I think the bug is in the if block. Please Help Me! Following are my LogCat errors that will help you to find the bug.

"Deserialize JSON to 2 different models <p>Does Newtonsoft.JSON library have a simple way I can automatically deserialize JSON into 2 different Models/classes?</p>

  ""guardian_name"": ""Foo Bar"",
  ""patient_id"": ""938"",
  ""patient_name"": ""Foo Bar"",

"Bootstrap 4 error ""Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js"", with Aurelia CLI and Require.js <p>I'm having trouble configuring Bootstrap 4 beta in an Aurelia CLI app (v0.31.1) with requirejs and using TypeScript. After having tried several config variations I keep on getting the following console error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the steps to reproduce. First, install the packages:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install --save jquery bootstrap@4.0.0-beta popper.js
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I've configured <strong>aurelia.json</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>  ""jquery"",
  {
    ""name"": ""popper.js"",
    ""path"": ""../node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd"",
    ""main"": ""popper""
  },
  {
    ""name"": ""bootstrap"",
    ""path"": ""../node_modules/bootstrap/dist"",
    ""main"": ""js/bootstrap.min"",
    ""deps"": [
      ""jquery"",
      ""popper.js""
    ],
    ""exports"": ""$"",
    ""resources"": [
      ""css/bootstrap.css""
    ]
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the config above that: </p>

<ul>
<li>popper.js is registered before bootstrap</li>
<li>the UMD module is used</li>
<li>popper.js is set as a dependency for bootstrap, next to jquery</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, in my <strong>app.ts</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import 'bootstrap';
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, building using <code>au build</code> works fine. But upon running, using <code>au run --watch</code> I get the following console errors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js (<a href=""https://popper.js.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://popper.js.org</a>) (defaults.js:19)<br>
  Uncaught Error: Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js (<a href=""https://popper.js.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://popper.js.org</a>) (bootstrap.min.js:6)<br>
  ... a bit further on:<br>
  Uncaught TypeError: plugin.load is not a function at Module. (defaults.js:19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the Bootstrap 4 docs only mention <a href=""https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/webpack/"" rel=""noreferrer"">instructions on webpack</a>. So does a search on both Aurelia's <a href=""https://gitter.im/aurelia/Discuss"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gitter.im channel</a> and on StackOverflow. I cannot find samples regarding Aurelia CLI with Require.js. Finally, Google hits shows only examples for embedding the alpha versions (which relied on 'tethering' rather than 'popper').</p>

<p>Similar questions on SO, which have the same error but aren't applicable to my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45645971/bootstrap-4-beta-importing-popper-js-with-webpack-3-x-throws-popper-is-not-a-con"">Bootstrap 4 Beta importing Popper.js with Webpack 3.x throws Popper is not a constructor</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45680644/angular-4-bootstrap-dropdown-require-popper-js"">Angular 4 Bootstrap dropdown require Popper.js</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Bootstrap+dropdown+require+Popper.js"">And several more...</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question: how can I configure Bootstrap 4 with Popper.js in an Aurelia CLI app (using Require.js, not Webpack)?</p>

"Is it possible to give AWT applications sharp taskbar icons in Windows 10 <p>I'm trying to set the icon of a Java AWT application so it renders in native resolution on the Windows 10 taskbar (including when desktop scaling is set above 100%).  It seems that by default, if an executable embeds an icon containing multiple sizes, Windows seems to pick a size larger than the actual size of taskbar icons and downsize it (at 100% scale it resizes the 32 pixel icon to 24, <em>even if a 24 pixel icon is supplied</em>, and similarly for other scales.)</p>

<p>I've solved this problem for C++ MFC applications by loading just the correctly sized icon as a resource and sending a WM_SETICON message to the window, which results in a nice sharp icon on the taskbar and alt-tab dialog.</p>

<pre><code>smallIcon = (HICON)LoadImage( myInstance, MAKEINTRESOURCE(smallIconRes), IMAGE_ICON, smallIconSize, smallIconSize, LR_DEFAULTCOLOR );
SendMessage(hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_SMALL, (LPARAM)smallIcon);

bigIcon   = (HICON)LoadImage( myInstance, MAKEINTRESOURCE(bigIconRes),   IMAGE_ICON, bigIconSize,   bigIconSize,   LR_DEFAULTCOLOR );
SendMessage(hWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG,   (LPARAM)bigIcon); 
</code></pre>

<p>That approach doesn't seem to work for Java applications - a WM_SETICON message with wParam set to ICON_SMALL works fine, but the equivalent with ICON_BIG is ignored.</p>

<p>If I try to use Java's API to set the icon, by doing this</p>

<pre><code>    List&lt;Image&gt; icons = new ArrayList&lt;Image&gt;();
    icons.add(windowIcons.getIcon(20)); // small icons are 20x20 pixels
    icons.add(windowIcons.getIcon(30)); // large are 30x30 at 125% scale
    setIconImages(icons);

<p>the correct icon is used but it appears blurry, as if something has resized it to the ""expected"" size and then resized it back.  Left here is how it appears, right is the contents of the icon file.</p>

"Is the arguments object supposed to be an iterable in ES6? <p>In ES6, I was trying to use the <code>arguments</code> object as an iterable when passed to the <code>Set</code> constructor.

"What am I doing wrong while finishing drywall inside corners? <p>I'll admit, I'm definitely a novice when it comes to finishing drywall.  I've done loads of patching, which doesn't typically require working with corners.  This time, however, I'm doing a whole room. </p>

<p>I watched some YouTube videos, and read a few articles online about how to properly finish inside corners.  Everybody makes it look so simple, but I just can't seem to get the hang of it. </p>

<p>The process goes something like this...</p>

<ol>
<li>Put <em>some</em> drywall compound on each side of the corner.</li>
<li>Fold the paper tape in half.</li>
<li>Press the tape into the mud.</li>
<li>Place a corner trowel in the corner, and with gentle pressure on the back of the trowel draw it down (or up) the corner.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first problem I was running into, was that instead of the trowel sliding along the tape. The tape was being pushed along by the trowel, and it would bunch up and be removed from the corner. I solved this by pressing a bit more gently, and holding the tape in place just to get started.</p>

<p>The next problem I ran into, was that while I slide the trowel down the corner, the tape would ripple and bunch up ahead of the trowel. To fix this, I had to use my taping knife to smooth the wrinkles out of the tape. While this worked in the long run, it seems less than ideal. This extra step was never mentioned in any of the videos or articles, which made me wonder what I was doing wrong.  </p>

"Sub-panel installation in a detached garage correctly done? <p>I have a small subpanel next to my main house panel with only 4 slots. I am out of breaker spaces, so I've routed 8 gauge wiring (2-120V split phase, 1-nuetral and 1 ground) to the new sub-panel. Very short run of less than 6 feet of wiring between the panels. I have filled only two slots with a ganged 30 amp breaker in the sub-panel that I need for some testing equipment in my garage (both panels and in a detached garage). I will likely put 2 additional 15 amp breakers in the future in the sub-panel. I have tied all 8 awg wires into the main busses. Neutral and ground are bonded, but I've run separate wires to the bonded bus. I believe this is a very conservative, safe installation, but is it code, or even good practice? The 8 gauge wiring is ultimately protected by the main disconnect breaker (200 amps) since I've tied to the buss directly, but the voltage drop in only 1-2 volts, so even a direct short should not overheat the wiring. I don't have any spare slots in the main panel to install a ganged 50 amp breaker - would like to do that, but just don't have the space. I guess I could pull two existing 15 amp breakers, install the ganged 50 amp and reroute the existing services to the new 15 amp breakers in the sub-panel - and I can do that if the only safe installation.

"Is there a way to remove paint from cinderblock walls that is not sand/glassbead-blasting? <p>The basement in our 1979-era house has cinderblock walls.  These walls have a tacky (DryLok perhaps?

<p>In many places it's possible to pull off large strips of the paint &amp; white stuff right off the wall where it has bubbled away from the block.   In other places the latex paint comes off with a paint scraper, but not nearly as easily.  Peeling does not always remove the pasty white layer.

"Connecting neutrals in disconnect switch <p>Disconnects are an inexpensive way to connect to relatively large gauge conductors for 40-100A applications.

Anyone got a more economical suggestion?</p>

"Do twin-blade circular saws reduce tearout? <p>Do twin-blade / Twincutter circular saws produce a more accurate cut than regular circular saws? Do they have less kick-back? Do they reduce the tearout / splintering / chipping at the rear of the cut, compared to regular, single-blade circular saws?

<p>The Twin-Cutter circular saws have two circular saw-blades spinning in opposite directions.

"Plumbing issue throughout house - gurgling coming from shower, bubbling in toilet, standing water in drain of shower <p><strong>Update below: Main line snaked</strong></p>

<p>For reference, <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/8wKYJ"" rel=""nofollow"">images of the drain</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going through the whole story in case any details might make a difference in prognosis. If you aren't interested in the introductory details and want to just skip to the part about the shower, skip to the Shower heading.</p>

<h1>Toilet</h1>

<p>This plumbing incident began late night on Tuesday, January 19. The apartment has one bathroom with one sink, one toilet, and one standing shower. Additionally, there is a sink in the kitchen. There are no further appliances or fixtures involving water.</p>

<p>My wife showered at around 9 PM. Her shower lasted approximately one hour. I showered at about 10:30 PM and my shower lasted approximately 20 minutes. All was well.</p>

<p>I decided to do some dishes. Hot water only. I did the dishes for about 15 minutes. Upon finishing, I went to the bathroom. I've since forgotten why. I saw a pool of water covering about 10 square feet of the bathroom.  I thought to myself, <em>Well, that can't be from the shower. Some water occasionally spills out because the curtain is annoying as all hell, but this is a pool.</em> I went to turn on the water in the kitchen sink again - this time, cold - and nothing happened. I switched it back to hot to see if that was the problem and I saw the toilet leaking water from underneath the decorative bolt caps. Gross.</p>

<p>At this point, it's almost midnight. We did some online research to see what could cause such a problem and decided upon the wax ring being compromised. We went and bought some supplies to handle this issue from a 24-hour Walmart. Only had an Oatley wax ring as our selection.</p>

<p>Got home, cleaned up all the water. Started my attempt on fixing this thing. Took me hours. I'm reassembling the toilet and notice I need some new bolts and washers for the tank to bowl connection. One of the bolts had silicone caulk covering it from inside the tank. Head to Lowe's. It's like 6-something AM at this point. I'm dead tired. Get the stuff, come back, install it. Can't get them tight enough or I tightened them too much and they're leaking. So much fun. Re-caulk the toilet, try to get on with life and maybe they're not even really leaking anymore.</p>

<p>We use the restroom, all seems to be okay. I turn on the water in the kitchen and, again, the toilet lets water out from the base through underneath the decorative bolt caps. What a headache.</p>

<p>We call the landlord about the problem, having now tried to solve it ourselves. She claims she can't afford a plumber and must send her handyman, who has proven to be an issue in the complex. Instead, I enlist the help of a neighbor who knows a good bit about household maintenance. He shows me the mistakes I made in installing the wax ring (I didn't want to sit on a dirty toilet from touching it after all the work, so I just pushed down on the back where the tank rests to try to seal the wax ring), the bolts for the flange, the tightness of the tank-to-bowl bolts, and informs me of the flange being below the tile level. Since the wax ring is pretty messed up at this point, I go and get a wax-less ring. He informs me that the flange isn't drilled down. He tries to secure it, but can't because he doesn't have a cement drill bit on hand. We move on. He places the old wax ring underneath the new wax-less ring just for some additional help, he says. We get everything situated - bowl secured and doesn't seem to move when moving from side to side or front to back, the tank is secured, the base is caulked, the new hose is installed securely.</p>

<p>We're nervous. We don't turn the sink on in the kitchen for too long, other than to wash some produce or our hands. We use the restroom several times. All seems okay, except for not testing the kitchen sink being on. </p>

<h1>Shower</h1>

<p>My wife attempts to shower. Within ten seconds of getting in the shower, water rises up the drain and covers her feet. Great. Another problem. It's been a long day, so we hit the hay to approach this problem rested in the morning.</p>

<p>We arrive at today, January 21. We used Drano Max Gel. Full 32-ounce bottle. Waited 30 minutes. Started rinsing with hot water from the shower and water begins rising in the drain. We turn off the water, disappointed. We give it 15 more minutes and check again. No dice. At this point, we know it's probably unwise to use anymore chemical drain cleaner, but we're desperate. We go and grab Liquid Plumr Slow-Flow Fighter, 17 ounces. We pour the entire bottle in, slowly, as directed, and wait. We were busy doing other things and left it there for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Water rises again and we turn off the water. We know doing a third batch of any chemical drain cleaner would be pointless and extremely damaging, as were the first two. We see water down the pipe and think the standing water might be because we failed. </p>

<p>We look online for alternatives and decide to try using boiling water as that's easy enough and doesn't cost us more than a dime of gas. The first round makes the water in the pipe disappear. Okay, maybe another round for good measure? We try another round and the water in the pipe is still there. We decide to try running the shower and just waiting it out to see if that'll help at all. The water rises to about two inches below the top of the drain but then subsides a bit. </p>

<p>We let the hot water run for 20 minutes and see some bubbles over a foot down the pipe. It didn't come back up, but the bubbles make us wary. Furthermore, you can see water when you look down the pipe. Reading online, it seems like that would be the water in the p-trap. The second image of the album shows a look down the drain a bit with the flash on. You can see where the water is in the drain. Is that bad or is that just water in the p-trap?</p>

<p>When can we be sure this is normal operation? We're scared to do dishes, use the restroom, or shower. Is there anything additional we should be doing? If you've read this far, thank you.</p>

<p>As of about an hour ago, using the hot water in the sink for approximately 5 minutes caused the toilet to start bubbling. I immediately turned off the water and the water in the bowl receded slightly, but did not drain more than half its normal amount. This is the first occurrence of bubbling in the toilet.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: We used the hot in the sink again and bubbling continued. We waited it out to see if it would subside and toilet begin filling with water. Immediately turned off water for the kitchen sink. We tried flushing the toilet and it would not drain and water began to leak from the base. We consulted with the neighbor again and he checked out the toilet and plunged it a bit. Upon seeing that that wasn't doing the trick, we tried to use a garden hose stuck into the main to attempt to force the clog out, since we have no snake on hand. The plunging had forced the cover off the clean out on the other side of the bathroom wall along the same line as the toilet. Attempting to use the hose in the clean out by the kitchen sink did not yield results and began to back the toilet up again. Same results for the clean out opposite the toilet.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Someone came out and snaked the main line. For how big this clog seemed, nothing monumental came out. A bit of hair, a bit of an obstruction was felt and that was it. Very underwhelming and worries us that the problem wasn't solved. Are those typical results or might there be cause for concern regarding whether the issue was resolved?</p>

"How to remove narrow metal soffit <p>Our 1954 home has very narrow soffits, with metal over them. The best solution I've come up with for adding soffit vents is 2 inch hockey puck style. I did a few several years ago and stopped. See photo:</p>

"Can I stud out a wall without removing the plaster <p>I'm in the process of re-doing my kitchen.  One of the issues I have to deal with is that the original construction is double brick, furred out with 1 inch strips, then plaster over gypsum.

"What are good Relative Humidity and Temperature settings on an MHRV and are the settings related? <p>I need to configure the threshold Relative Humidity and Temperature settings on an whole house MHRV system.</p>

<p>The way the system works is that if the RH threshold is exceeded the system increases the fan speed to supply outside air into the house and extract more old air out of the house.</p>

<p>If the temperature threshold is exceeded and the air outside is colder than the inside temperature then it bypasses the heat exchanger to supply the air into the house without pre-warming. It also bypasses the heat exchanger if the inside temperature is lower than the threshold and the external temperature is higher than the internal temperature.</p>

<p>Are the two settings related, does my choice of target temperature affect what I should choose for RH?</p>

<p>Does the climate I am in (southern UK if it helps) and time of year affect what I should choose, how does it affect it?</p>

<p>Is there anything else I should consider when selecting the settings?</p>

"How to wire MR16 LED lights? <p>I am building a wall cabinet with downlights in the shelves, for which I would like to use MR16 LEDs. However, my first attempt was obviously deficient, since two of the LEDs blew. I'd appreciate some help to figure out a) what went wrong, and b) what I need to install them properly.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KEque.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can hopefully see in the image above, I have a single transformer, which has the following specifications:</p>

<pre><code>Electronic Transformer for LV-Halogen Lamps
PRI: 220-240V ~50Hz 0.27A
SEC: 11.5V~ 10-60W λ=0.99
</code></pre>

<p>I have four 12V, 4W MR16 LEDs wired in parallel to the transformer. When I connected them all up to the power, they seemed to burn fine, without any noticeable flicker; after about 30 min, one of the lights went out, and I thought it might have been my wiring. After another 10 min or so, another light blew with an audible pop. At that point I realised there was something wrong with my setup and switched it off.</p>

<p>When all four LEDs were burning, and when only three were working, I took some voltage readings, which were around 4.5-4.6V (nowhere near the expected 12V).</p>

<p>I have considered 4 possible issues here:</p>

<p>1) The LEDs are expecting DC input, and are getting fried by the AC current. When I bought the transformer (from the same store that sold me the LEDs), I specifically asked if I needed a DC transformer, and the assistant replied that they didn't have any other kind of transformer, and that this was what they used in their in-store demonstration arrays. The LED packaging makes no mention of whether they need AC or DC current.</p>

<p>2) The LEDs are wired in parallel, when they need to be wired in series to give the necessary resistance for the transformer to work.</p>

<p>3) The LEDs are too far from the transformer, resulting in voltage drop (the maximum distance is about 1.5-2m).</p>

<p>4) The transformer is faulty.</p>

<p>I don't have the knowledge to diagnose which of these issues (or combination thereof) is at fault here, so any advice will be gratefully received.</p>

<p>Edit: I am in South Africa, with 220V AC mains electrical supply.</p>

"How can I attach pony wall to surface of platform and will it be strong enough against lateral forces? <p>I have a loft area to which I want to add a pony wall for safety. My plan is to drywall its inside and outside faces, all the way down across the beam. Can I built it on the surface of the platform safely? I would prefer to avoid attaching the posts to the front of the beam because it would make drywalling more difficult, and I want to use the posts located at the corner as an anchor for some storage that should all appear flush. The beam is 5 1/8"" wide so putting it <em>inside</em> the beam, against a joist, leaves too large a distance on the outside edge.</p>

<p>Here are some researched suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built pony wall and lag-bolt the corner post through an angle bracket, down through the pony wall's bottom plate and into the beam.</li>
<li>Can I lag-bolt 4x4 posts to a 2x4 bottom plate from the bottom, which is then lag bolted through the subfloor and into the beam?</li>
<li>Extend plywood down the pony-wall onto the beam to provide strength across the entire face without adding too much thickness.</li>
<li>Use a thicker wall - perhaps cabinets - so there is more depth to anchor down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IGNGr.gif"" alt=""bench example 2""></p>

<p>I thought this would be a standard sort of newbie project and was expecting to find loads of plans, drawings, tutorials etc how to make one. Unfortunately an hour spent googling did not show anything useful.</p>

<p>Does anyone have some good resources that can help me learn the basics to allow me to complete this project? I'm not necessarily looking for a complete set of drawings/instruction for a corner bench (although that would help) but some basic instruction on building basic furniture.</p>

<p>For example, how do I attach the legs without the screws showing? How do I complete the corner join of the benches etc.</p>

<p>Any hints or tips for this newbie will be hugely helpful</p>

"I want to permanently remove and fill-in below grade windows in multi-family building. What's the risk? <p>I have a 5 family apartment building in NJ. There are 2 below grade window wells that protrude from the building and into the asphalt driveway. I want to fill these in permanently with concrete because the windows leak like crazy, and the wells are huge hazards (for tripping and the metal grates have caved in several times when someone drives over them). </p>

<p>What's the risk over filling them in? </p>

<p>The basement is unfinished. These 2 windows do not open. There are 2 other window on the opposite side of the basement that do open (and are not a problem).  Also, the tenants do not have access to the basement. The only people who go down there are myself and the meter readers. It's a full basement with 5 boilers, 1 hot water heater, 6 electrical meters and 6 gas meters.</p>

"Can I use a dimmer on a fan IF I only use at 100%? <p>I have an IRIS home automation system. I want to put my fan on an IRIS switch however the on/off switches require a neutral - the dimmers do not. The neutral in the box is nearly impossible to get to... so my thoughts were to just use a dimmer but only run it at 100%.

"Furniture needs to be attached to the wall, but my tenancy agreement doesn't allow it <p>I've just rented an unfurnished apartment. Obviously I need some furniture. However, wherever I look (IKEA and similar websites), the instructions for any furniture I look at say that it has to be fixed to the wall, to prevent it from falling over.</p>

"Is it normal for uPVC window shutters to be pre-fitted to the frame at the factory or not? <p>I recently had some uPVC windows installed at home in South Bombay (Mumbai),
India. It was not a positive experience. The people who manufactured
and installed it were Deceuninck fabricators based in New Bombay (New
Mumbai).</p>

<p>I don't want this to become excessively long, so I won't go into
detail about my buying experience. However, I do have a specific
question about the installation process, so I will describe that in
some detail.</p>

<p>The uPVC window frames and shutters were manufactured at the
factory. Then were then bought to the site where they were installed.
This installation was not exactly a smooth process. There were three
people working on installing 4 windows for basically all of Sunday 9th
November, and then again on Monday from 5.30 pm to 8 pm. That's a lot
of time.</p>

<p>To start with, the installers spent a long time fiddling with the
window frames. They said the frames were supposed to be manufactured
with a total of 5 mm space on the sides, but apparently this had not
been done, at least not consistently, They did a lot of hammering and
filing, particularly on one specific window (call this Window 2).</p>

<p>After that, they spent even more time installing the window shutters
into the windows. There was lots of manipulation and
adjustment. Again, at the end of the installation, they spent several
hours on one shutter (call this Window 4). When working on it on
Sunday, they left the shutter badly misaligned, with a lot of space
showing at the top. When they came back Monday afternoon (5.30 pm or
so), they spent some more time on it. When they were finishing, the
light had gone, and we thought the problem (gap at the top of the
shutter) had been fixed, but it hadn't. At this time
of writing (November 24th) the problem has not yet been fixed.</p>

<p>There were also some minor issues with the top and bottom latches on
the left hand shutter. They were too tight; you had to pull the
windows inward hard to latch them.</p>

<p>In another case, a window (again Window 4) did not close properly,
because there was some obstruction.</p>

<p>In all these cases we had to stand there and point out these issues;
the workers didn't seem to notice them.</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by the extremely manual approach
to setup that is being used here. It seems obvious that a sensible
approach to window installation is to fit the (factory manufactured) uPVC window shutters into the (factory manufactured) uPVC window frames at the factory, making sure they are a perfect fit, before bringing them to the site. The positioning of the shutters with respect to the frame is the only thing that matters, assuming that the frame is correctly installed in a proper vertically oriented position.</p>

<p>Presumably, in a factory there would be machinery/equipment to assist
one in doing so. Doing this only on site seems like a very bad idea,
really labor-intensive, and likely to lead to sub-optimal results as
described above. Is this common practice in this industry, speaking
internationally? I would expect better from a big international
company like Deceuninck. I imagine in countries where labor is more
expensive, this would need to be done differently. Does anyone have
any idea what the prevailing practice in India is?</p>

<p>To be clear, I don't actually <em>know</em> that the fabricators didn't fit
the shutters into the window frames at the factory, but comments that
their manager made suggested not. I asked him why they didn't pre-fit
the windows, and he responded that ""no-one does that"". And if they had
been pre-fitted at the factory, surely it would not have been so much
trouble to install them at the site.</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that my reasons for asking this question was unclear. I'm not
trying to take any action against the people who did this work. I just want some information about standard industry practices, since (as I have attempted to explain) I found the process used rather puzzling. Or, putting it another way, I want to know whether I should expect similar things from someone else doing similar work. From what people have said so far, what I have experienced is not unusual, which I find surprising. But I'm not familar with the building industry in India, or anywhere else, for that matter.</p>

"Exhaust fumes seeping into our 4th floor apartment at night through bathroom and shower vents/fans <p>This is our second fall/winter in our 4th floor apartment, and we've noticed that whenever the weather becomes cool, exhaust fumes which seem to come from the garage in the basement of the apartment building, seep into our apartment through the bathroom vent/fan and the shower vent/fan (both are separate rooms).

<p>We live in Salzburg, and I've been to the doctor many times (for myself and my child) and they dismiss the complaints about headaches, stomachaches and nausea - and never address it! Our pediatrician said it must be the ""change of weather/climate"" we are experiencing from having moved to Salzburg!</p>

Believe me, I'm freaking out about this and I can't sleep anymore...I don't know what to do - it's just one thing after another... first the mold, then a chain-smoking neighbor who would smoke all night and the stench would seep into our house (our landlady said there is nothing we can do about it), and now this (which has been going on for who knows how long!!). I purchased a CO detector today and put it in the bathroom (ELRO RM355). I'm worried that if, as some of you say, this doesn't pick it up - I will have no proof. I've been apartment hunting for 8 months now and am exhausted.</p>

<p>Could it be that being on the top floor of the building is the issue? As in, all odors, smoke and gases rise to the top?! I try to take my child outdoors as much as I can, and at night I run the fans and try to open the windows - but it's getting colder.</p>

<p>Just wanted to add that smell gets real bad in the middle of the night - it does smell like car exhaust fumes, but I don't think we have any neighbors running their cars in the garage at 3 am. </p>

<p>Also, if I do seal the vents with saran wrap, will it cause mold? 
The CO detector hasn't picked anything up yet...</p>

"Would adding new basement windows jeopardize the integrity of the foundation? <p>We are finishing our basement and would like to install 4 new hopper windows onto the front side of the house.  My question is what is the largest reasonably sized window that can be cut from the concrete without degrading the integrity of the house, assuming that 4 windows are being added to the front of the house, one under each first floor window (new basement windows would be no wider than the existing 1st floor windows). </p>

<p>When we laid out approximately where the windows would go (underneath each of the 1st floor windows) and used the width of the existing hopper windows we have (32""), they all span 2 joists.  Reducing the width of the window results in only 1 of the 3 spanning 2 joists.  </p>

<p>An idea I came across is the possibility of adding something like a steel angle bar that could be inserted to replace the wood sill and overlap onto the concrete by 8 to 10 inches.  The steel angle bar of beam would support the joists and everything above them and the concrete would support the angle bar/beam.  </p>

"Is this flue dangerous? <p>I had access to a ladder the other day, so naturally I was poking around in the attic of our house where we have lived for about a year. Above the closet where the furnace and water heater are located, I found there was a metal flue that didn't extend all the way through the roof, it just stops in the attic. Is this normal? There was a flue right next to it that did extend through the roof. The house was built in 1999 and we haven't had any problems since living here. I looked in the furnace room closet and couldn't see anything that might be connected to it. The building inspector didn't mention anything about it when we bought the house. Here's some photos:</p>

"Tiny House Sewer System Advice - Automatic Sewage Pump or Macerator Pump <p>I'm in the process of doing some landscaping and want to run some electrical / plumbing for a future house (building next summer). </p>

<p>The plan right now is to have a storage tank behind or below the tiny house for waste water then pump it 60' or so to the main house's sewer line.  I'm debating between the following (pretty similar):</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Sewage Pump</strong></p>

<p>These are usually used for basement bathrooms where the main sewer line is above the plumbing. It consists of a tank with a pump inside of it. When the pump detects the water level has reached a certain height, it automatically turns on and pumps out all the waste in the tank through 2"" pipes (usually vertically).  </p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Runs automatically</li>
<li>Tried and tested in many homes</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't macerate (cut up) waste at all, worry it could get stuck somewhere along the 60' of pipe or something.</li>
<li>I have 1.5"" pipe sitting around. Poor excuse, but would be nice to get rid of it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Macerating Pump</strong></p>

<p>These are more often used to pump out waste from RVs. They connect to the holding tank (externally, as opposed to internally for the sewage pump). When you turn them on they'll macerate (cut up into 1/8"" pieces) and pump the sewage out through the 3/4"" output.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Macerates to reduce chance of clogging.</li>
<li>Need smaller pipe (only 3/4"")</li>
<li>Pump is external (easier/less messy to maintain / replace).</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not automatic. Could wire to a switch and many have sensor to detect moisture so it'll automatically turn off. But still, not automatic.</li>
<li>Haven't really seen them used in house (tiny or big) at all.</li>
</ul>

"How can I stop new solid oak floor from squeaking? <p>really hope someone here can come up with an idea to get me out of this one:</p>

<p>I recently laid a new floor in my dining room, it's solid oak and it actually looks quite good considering I put it down!</p>

<p>Only problem is, it's quite creaky when you walk on it. </p>

<p>I asked a few friends (one contractor builder, the rest just amateur DIY'ers like me) about the best way to lay it, and they all said to install it as a ""floating"" floor. So I went out and bought a load of fixing clips, and as I went along, I put one clip about every 3 foot from each other between each strip of flooring.</p>

<p>Now I'm not so sure if that was needed, as I was laying it onto existing floorboards. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's the fixing clips which are causing the floor to creak, but I don't think I'm going to be able to lift it all up (without damaging it all), as the clips are holding it all together pretty tight. Any ideas on how I can stop the creaking?</p>

"How to remove stuck Rawl bolts <p>I'm trying to affix a ground-anchor to my garage floor (for chaining things to.</p>

<p>It was supplied with Rawl bolts and the instructions stated to drill a 16mm hole into the concrete and then tap the bolt into the hole.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions to the letter (1 minor deviation described later)</p>

<p>The Rawl bolt is like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/C6PYu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's where the trouble comes in - I didn't ""tap"" the bolt into the hole - I gave it a good, solid hammering - I've used these things before and widened the hole to allow that bolt to go in easier - but then found that it didn't hold firmly enough when tightened and whatever it was fell down... So this time I decided that I'd make it a snug fit and ended up giving it a good bashing to get it in - what I didn't realise was that it wasn't the diameter of the hole that was the problem, but rather the build up of concrete dust that I'd left in the hole after drilling.</p>

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p>The real problem is that there was concrete dust sitting in the bottom of the hole - by hammering the bolt holder into the hole to try and get it flush with the garage floor - 2 things have happened:</p>

<p>1) The cone shaped bit at the bottom has been forced up in the bolt holder - forcing the leaves outwards (as is it's purpos) and jamming the holder into the hole in the concrete. The standard advice on this is to tap the conical piece down again  - but I don't think this is possible as it's got compacted concrete dust under it.</p>

<p>2) The threaded hole in the conical piece is full of concrete dust, so I can't screw the bolt into it - it goes in about 1.5 turns, then jams up on concrete dust - I can see this from the threads on the bolt when I remove it.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any suggestions on how to:</p>

<p>a) Suck the concrete dust out of the hole?</p>

<p>b) Get the bolt holder out of the hole altogether so that I can start afresh?</p>

<p>We want to fix the slab in the stairwell and would prefer to make the fix in the garage as well. We have so far gotten a quote for ""slabjacking"" using polymer foam for around $1,500.

<p>One stand has White + Black, but the other has White + Black + Red. The two blacks are tied together and go nowhere. The two wites are tied together and go to the light, and the red goes to the light (where I generally would use a black).</p>

<p>My original plan, was to pull the wire back to the switch (along with the new wire that I would use for the potlights). But with two wires going to the fixture, I'm not sure where/what the other wire would be for. I can still pull one back to the fixture, but I would rather try to figure out what the other one may be for before I do anything like that.</p>

<p>Any ideas what the second line would be for? If I continue with my plan, of pulling the one wire back to the switch I should be able to replace it with new romex for the potlight, wire it up the same and have no problems?</p>

"Is my ""modified bitumen"" roof installed correctly? <p>Album here: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/3NhKm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/3NhKm</a></p>

<p>My new roof was installed last week. I had a 400 sq. foot section of flat roof that was supposed to receive modified bitumen. I wanted to add a bit of pitch but the estimator/project manager pushed back on that idea because he said the cost of framing would be exorbitant. All I really wanted was a couple of inches to eliminate the ponding so I asked about tapered insulation. He had never heard of it but asked his guy, came back with a reasonable price, and I approved it and signed the deal.</p>

<p>Well, when they showed up they came with standard 1/2 inch foam board from Lowe's. I shot that down immediately and made them try to find tapered insulation like I wanted while they seemed to have not ever heard of this product and insinuated it was some exotic material largely of my own imagining. (I replied, ""Go on Google, search for ""tapered insulation"", and you will find it is manufactured, by Owens Corning, GAF, Firestone, Johns Manville, etc."") Well, the price came back as ""expensive"" (I didn't ask) and the owner offered to frame out some pitch for the same price as the original agreement. As that was all I wanted in the first place, I agreed.</p>

<p>Well, after the crew left I went up to inspect my new ""modified bitumen"" roof membrane and found something that does not look like any modified bitumen membrane I am used to seeing. I have always seen cap sheets that pretty much resemble three tab or laminated/architectural shingles in texture and rigidity. This is almost smooth, with a very fine grain, and is very soft. It's squishy and you can't touch it when the sun is on it without leaving a mark. </p>

<p>As far as the roofing company is concerned, they are done. If this is a base sheet, they have no plans of coming back to put a cap sheet on. There are also some installation quality issues. I'm trying to get another company out here for an opinion but am curious what you folks think.</p>

"Why can't I lay tiles on an uneven floor? <p>My buddy and I have gotten into a bit of a dispute on facebook, here's what he asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I keep hearing tiling an unlevel floor will result in tiles coming up. This reason makes no sense to me. The only reason a stable but unlevel floor will have tiles come up is if the bond between the cement and floor or tile fails. This failure should have NOTHING to do w/levelness of the floor, correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My response goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's the thing: Unless you use a LOT of paste underneath the tiles (which won't dry out properly so will crack fast) then you will have a potential for a lever situation once the paste that's under an uneven one <em>does</em> dry out (because it will). Then that will cause disruption under the other tiles. Can't you just lay another level of backerboard to try and get things mostly level?</p>
  
  <p>The more the floor is uneven the more you will have to use extra cement, which means it won't dry out at the same time. Here, I'll go ask the pros for you to see what you can do since apparently you don't like my idea of asking them.</p>

"ok to put these two water heaters on a sub-panel? <p>I have a sub-panel, with currently only a single conventional water heater connected (4500 watt non-simultaneous).  The sub-panel is protected by a 50amp double-pole breaker in the main panel, wired with 6ga Romex.  The water heater is wired with 10ga Romex, protected by a 30amp breaker in the sub-panel.   So far, so good.   However, I want to add a 5700 watt tankless water heater to the sub-panel; it also requires a 30amp breaker (and 10ga wire).   Is this ok ?  All wiring is sufficient to the size breaker protecting it, so it should be safe.   And we know it's ok for breakers in a panel to sum up to more than the main breaker for that panel (e.g. all the breakers in a main panel typically far exceed the panel's overall rating).  But the total wattage (should the tankless be activated while the main one is heating) would be 10.2kw, or 42.5 amps at 240v.   That seems to be cutting it close for the 50amp breaker protecting the main panel, so I'm wondering if I'm likely to see it trip.   Also don't want to violate code, even though this work will not be inspected.</p>

<p>My main circuit breaker panel is flush mounted in a drywalled 2x4 wall. The spa panel has an open knockout in the top that would align perfectly with a knockout in the bottom of my main panel. I would use a piece of straight conduit to connect the two panels.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<h3>Can the spa panel be recessed/flush-mounted in the wall or is it required that it be surfaced mounted to the wall?</h3>

<p>The reason I want it to be recessed/flush-mounted is so I can use a simple straight piece of conduit to connect the two panels.

<p>This is a picture of what I currently have that I'm not happy with. The conduit body at the bottom goes into the front of a junction box (does NEC allow that?) and the junction box has a piece of straight conduit up to the bottom of the main panel in the wall you can't see.

"I have an exterior water tap for a garden hose that needs new caulking <p>I noticed that the caulking around my outside water tap was beginning to deteriorate and crack. I removed the old caulking to find that the builder had filled the gap where the pipe goes into the brick with bits of wood. I'm guessing this was to help stabilize the pipe, but the wood is beginning to deteriorate as well. Is this common practice for builders and should I remove the wood pieces before proceeding or should I leave them?</p>

"Sprinkler valve solenoids won't activate at manifold <p>For years, the automatic sprinklers in my house worked fine (they were there when I bought the house).</p>

<p>A few months ago, I noticed that the station which controls drip irrigation for shrubs would not shut off. After some lightweight troubleshooting, I just closed the master valve, and watered the lawn manually.</p>

<p>I have fixed that problem (bad seating of an o-ring on the anti-siphon chamber), but now I have a bigger problem. None of the valves will turn on from the controller.</p>

<p>I have a RainBird E-6c controller. There are five valves (stations). I am not even trying to program the controller right now. I've reset it factory settings, and I'm using the Test Station mode to activate each station for about 1 minute at a time. I have disconnected all of the wires to the valves just to make sure that the voltages at the terminal are showing up as I expect, and they do. My multimeter registers about 27VAC on the terminal for an active station, and 0V on the terminal for an inactive station -- responding correctly to the testing mode. </p>

<p>I have removed a solenoid from the valve and connected it directly to the terminal (again, with no other wires connected to the terminal). For Station 1, the solenoid activates when the controller is supposed to activate it. I can not only measure about 24VAC across the common terminal to the station terminal where the solenoid is connected, and I can physically observe the plunger of the solenoid retract into the solenoid body, until the test mode ends in 1 minute, and the solenoid deactivates, releasing the plunger back to it normal position. I repeated this with an old solenoid and a brand new solenoid. Station active -> Solenoid activates, 24VAC across the wires. Station inactive -> Solenoid deactivates, 0VAC across the wires.</p>

<p>I disconnected the solenoid from the controller, and then connected the wires that lead out the manifold. Outside, I disconnected all of the solenoids from the wires. I set the controller to run the test mode across several stations, and then used the multimeter to check that about 24VAC is present at the wires I expect (the common wire and the specific station wire), and not at the other wires. I confirmed several times that, as long as there no load across the wires that run back to the controller, there is 24VAC on the active station wires.</p>

<p>However, when I connect any solenoid to the wires at the manifold (without even having them inserted into the valve body), none of the solenoids will activate, and the multimeter shows 0VAC across the wires. While the station is active, I can remove the solenoid (the same one that worked fine at the controller) from the live station wire, measure 24VAC on the wires, then put the solenoid back on the wire, and not only watch the multimeter register 0VAC, but the solenoid will not activate.</p>

<p>The solenoids are for Hunter brand sprinkler valves, if that matters (there is only one kind of solenoid for Hunter valves, I think).</p>

<p>What else can I test or try in order to get the solenoids to activate at the manifold, when I can see that they will activate at the controller, and I can measure 24VAC at the manifold? I feel like I'm going crazy.</p>

"How to hook up thermostat C wire? <p>I would appreciate a sanity check/advice from this community.</p>

<p>I plan to install a Wifi thermostat (likely a Honeywell) that requires a C wire in a house built in 2005.  It's propane forced air plus AC.  There is a blue wire running from the furnace to the (old, dumb) thermostat, but it's not connected to anything on either end.</p>

<ol>
<li>Shut off power to the furnace and AC at the breaker box.</li>

<li>Hook up the blue wire to new thermostat as part of installing it.</li>

<ul>
<li>What is better - centrifugal or induct? It looks like the centrifugal ones have best throughput but are they as reliable etc?</li>
<li>What rate is good? I can't find info on my old induct 23W fan's rate, but I assume it was in the range 80-100 m^3/hr - does that sound about right? Would going up to a 220 m^3/hr be excessive?</li>
<li>Does power affect anything other than the rate?</li>
</ul>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The inlet in the bathroom is in the ceiling</li>
<li>I don't really want to take out the old ducting &amp; fittings, so if it was a round, 125mm fan that would be great. Also 100mm would work I guess as I could still make the ducting fit.</li>
<li>Fan needs to have an adjustable timer on it so it stays on after the light is turned off - there is a permanent live circuit available. </li>
<li>Bathroom is approx 1.6m x 2.5m x 2.2m (i.e. 8.8 m^3) Using some recommendations from another answer, this would mean 70 m^3/hr would be fine... but it's not worked out that way before. Perhaps the timer wasn't on for long enough? Or perhaps I can double the throughput and halve the time?</li>

"How to make a toilet seat hinge more stiff? <p>The upstairs toilet in our house has a gender-specific problem:  the seat won't stay up without being held up.  This is because the lid of the cistern sticks out a bit too much, so that the seat's centre of gravity is slightly on the wrong side of the hinge.  I already replaced the seat when we moved in, it didn't make any difference:  basically, the holes in the toilet where you attach the seat are a bit too far back.  </p>

<p>I'm not going to try to fix this (very annoying, only for me) problem by replacing the toilet, or just the cistern.  But, what would work, if it's possible, is to make the seat a bit more stiff, ie resistant to movement.  It's only just on the wrong side of the vertical, so that if the hinge was a bit stiffer, i believe it would stay up by itself, without being resistant to movement in general (obviously it still needs to be lowerable so gluing it in a fixed position isn't an option).</p>

<p>There's no way to adjust the hinge, ie no screws to tighten, and it can't be taken apart without breaking it.  So what i'm after is some sort of ""anti lubricant"" that i can put into the hinge.  The hinge (on each side) consists of metal (or perhaps chrome-plated plastic) cylinders, which butt up against each other, similar to in this photo:  </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LqbX3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LqbX3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If i do put an ""anti-lubricant"" in there, it's going to have to be something that will be able to get into the tiny space between the rotating parts of the hinge.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a substance?  Or have any other solutions?  thanks, Max</p>

<p>EDIT: I have a 1 year old running around, so any solutions need to be child-friendly:  that means that if the solution uses magnets, for example, the magnets need to be very hard to swallow.</p>

<p>Before on the right, and after on the left.  Basically i unscrewed the seat and lid, loosened the discs that hold the hinges and rotated each one 180 degrees.  Fortunately i was able to rotate the vertical posts that hold the actual hinges as well, to keep the hinges pointing in the same direction as they were originally, but just an inch or so further forward, which made the crucial difference. </p>

"Did I just ruin the flange on our toilet? <p>The point where the elbow joint from our flushometer meets the toilet bowl has begun leaking (dripping, really) whenever we flush (so, whenever water passes through it). I jiggled it a bit and the elbow joint popped right out. So the connection seems to be an unthreaded pipe with a plastic gasket that slides into a threaded mounting ring (is that the right term?) that then threads onto the toilet. <i>update: it's a <a href=""http://www.grainger.com/Grainger/SlipNut-1PNW4?Pid=search"" rel=""nofollow"">slip joint nut</a></i></p>

<p>The gasket appears to be intact, so I think I can fix this by reinforcing the seal at the threading. I have a jar of pro-dope, a tube of durst pipe thread compound and a roll of what teflon tape.</p>

<p>Two questions: </p>

<p>Am I on the right track here? and Which should I use for the best seal?</p>

<p>PS. What is a flushometer? Ours is a <a href=""http://www.plumbingsupply.com/manual-exposed-flushometers-toilet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sloan Gem</a> for a ""back spud bowl"" (vs. a ""top spud bowl"") -- it reaches the toilet via an elbow rather than a straight pipe. Our toilet is a ways out from the wall so the joint has been extended by about 8"". </p>

<p>Update: not using the toilet wasn't really working for us so I took a stab at using pro-dope and re-assembling. </p>

<p>Here's the halfway point, after I unscrewed the <del>mounting ring</del> slip joint nut:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oya3a.jpg"" alt=""closeup of flange, gasket, mounting ring""></p>

<p>And the after:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cXWck.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can kind of tell from the after image that the toilet and the flushometer aren't properly aligned so the elbow joint doesn't meet the toilet at a proper 90° angle. </p>

<p>That worked, but there was still a tiny bead of water making its way out with every flush. I thought I'd be clever and get someone stronger than I to tighten the <del>mounting ring</del> slip joint nut.

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thank you for your comment  Tester101. That partially answers my question. An HVAC professional that inspected my system told me that it would ALWAYS be better to use the Mr. Slims, and I found that hard to believe. So I was wondering if others would say the same on here.</p>

"dripping sound in ceiling when central heating gets warm <p>I am a complete novice about plumbing so apologies in advance. Basically I have noticed that, when my central heating warms up I hear what sounds like a dripping noise in the ceiling. This seems to start slow, speed up then slow down. After a few seconds it will start again and so on, as long as the central heating is on. Once I switch off the heating it takes about half an hour for this dripping noise to stop completely. Is this likely to be a leak or is there another explanation?</p>

<p>My question is how deep do I need to bury the poles? There will be no ""load"" on the poles as the net weighs less than 40lbs total. I have read everything from two feet to 8 feet.. My plan was to dig 4' down and 16"" in diameter flared at the bottom of the hole and then plumb the poles and fill with concrete. About have way through the fill I was going to throw in 4 - 3' #4 rebar vertically then continue to fill.</p>

"Installing Ceiling Fan, Weird Double Switch Install <p>EDIT: Nevermind, I figured it out.  I just rewired the switches to that one isn't even connected and the other is connected properly and it works great.</p>

<p>My house was built back in the 70's and has had some renovations but we are new owners.  I am trying to replace the ceiling fan (something I have done multiple times previously with no issues) but I hit a bit of a snag due to the dual switch.  In this room there is a switch for the fan and another for the light.  The fan I am installing only has black, white, and ground wires because it is controlled via a remote control.  In the ceiling, there are only three wires, white, black, and ground.  Apparently these are not functioning as I would imagine due to the dual switch since when I installed things normally (white to white, black to black, green to ground) nothing happened.</p>

<p>I tried installing just a basic light that I have that only has white and black wires to diagnose the issue and finally I got it to turn on when I put the white to white and black to the ground.  This makes me guess whoever wired the switches did so in a way that the ground wire is essentially being used as a neutral which I imagine is not the proper way to do things. Since I have no need for a dual switch I assume it would be best to just go back to a single but this is about the extent of my electrician knowledge and it isn't something I want to just guess with.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures of the switches, I will explain everything that is happening with the wires below but sometimes a picture is a lot better.</p>

<p>[![][1]][1]<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHB8J.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHB8J.jpg"" alt=""""></a><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mG6tS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mG6tS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So the three wires coming from the ceiling are coming in on the right side.  The black ceiling wire is going to the top right spot on the right switch.  The white ceiling wire is going to the top right spot on the left switch.  The ceiling ground is connected to two white wires going behind the left switch (goes to a spot where one says + and the other says N).</p>

<p>The bottom right spots on both switches are connected by a small black wire.  On the bottom right spot of the right switch there is another black wire going to two other black wires and a red one that go behind the left switch same as the two white wires that accompany the ground from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Can I install the fan as is or is that a bad situation?  Is the best solution to just get rid of one switch and convert things to how it should be setup with one switch in the first place?  If so how would I correct the wiring?</p>

<p>The wall switch (that was included with the fan) looks like this unit: <a href=""http://img1.wfrcdn.com/docresources/604/11/116905.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img1.wfrcdn.com/docresources/604/11/116905.pdf</a></p>

<p>The ceiling box has five wires coming out of it, two white, one gray, one black and one green/bare (ground).  The black and gray were connected to the black &amp; blue leads from the old pull-chain fan &amp; light I removed.  The two white I am not sure, at least one was connected to the old fan white lead, but I'm not sure about the second, it may have come loose when I moved the fan, but it was not capped off. The black and one of the whites appear to be a slightly smaller gauge wire. The gray may just be a really old black.</p>

<p>Attached is a picture of the old mount before I installed the new, but you can see all of the aforementioned wires.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TYeUl.jpg"" alt=""ceiling junction""></p>

<p><strong>I connected the two house blacks to the black of the fan unit, and connected the two whites to the white of the fan unit, and of course the ground to the bracket.</strong> I used wire caps and tucked carefully into the canopy of the new fan while installing.</p>

<p>In the wall switch box, there are two switches, the <strong>left</strong> switch I assumed was for the fan but never used as it did not seem to do anything. My wife claims it would work the light, but I had the fan dismantled before realizing I may need to know that. (oops).</p>

<p>The <strong>right</strong> switch in the wall box controls a separate in-ceiling light in the room and in the hallway below.</p>

<p>For the left switch, there is a bare wire (ground) a white and a gray. Unfortunately the new fan control unit has a green (ground) and two blacks, one says <strong>TO FAN</strong> and the other says <strong>TO POWER</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is the way I have wired the switch:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6MN8v.jpg"" alt=""wall switch remote""></p>

<p>I have tried two wiring setups in the ceiling junction:</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>
Ceiling gray and black connected to fan black. Both whites to fan white.
This worked at first to turn on the light and fan at a single speed, but became unresponsive to further commands. </p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>
Capped off separately the smaller gauge black and white in the ceiling, and put the ceiling gray to fan black, and white to fan white.
Unfortunately, this resulted in <strong>no activity</strong> at the fan after restoring power and trying the switch.</p>

<p>I am out of ideas at this point.</p>

<p>Attached is a picture of the electrical connection guide in the manufacturer's instructions. The receiver unit in the fan canopy came pre-connected and mounted.

"How to protect outside cable wire from myself? <p>I have a lovely standard black cable wire that wraps almost around my entire house, through, over and under dirt, mulch, rocks, bushes, daffodils...you name it this darn wire hits it all. An arborvitae has lifted it up 2.5 feet into the air at one point. </p>

<p>Before I end up running over it with a mower, or slicing it by way of a shovel or clippers I need to do something with it. </p>

<p>First question is, is it fine the way it is?  I live in the Northeast and we get hot summers and cold winters.  I assume the hot summer sun doesn't provide any benefits. 
Should I wrap the sucker in some sort of metal conduit or pvc tubing? </p>

<p>Second question, is it safe to just bury? with or without protection?</p>

<p>Third, currently it is one continuous piece, if I do decide to bury it, I am going to have to cut it somewhere to be able to rethread it behind bushes and set it back closer to the house/foundation.  Will I need a special outdoor cable connector to protect it from water? or is a standard thread connection ok. </p>

"Shower periodically loses hot water, and then the bath faucet will be scalding <p>I am in a 3 story apartment building with roughly 20 units.  Periodically while taking a shower the water will suddenly lose heat and become ice cold.  I chalked this up to lack of hot water coming from the main water heater, but today I tried flipping the diverter back down during one of these spells so that water came out of the tub faucet.  Much to my surprise, this water was scaling hot.  I could flip the diverter several times and the effect was robust: scalding water out of the tub faucet, icy water out of the showerhead.  After a minute or two the spell ended, and it went back to normal water from both fixtures.</p>

<p>What could be causing this?  Note that there wasn't any water leaking from the showerhead while the tub faucet was on, or vice versa.</p>

<p>EDIT: My landlord stopped by and checked out the diverter.  It didn't haven't any visible problems, but he replaced it to see if that would help.  It did, and now the shower seems to work without any issue.  I still don't really know what the problem was, but hopefully this info will be useful to someone else.</p>

"Corrosion around hot water heater connection? <p>I installed an electric hot water heater about 3-4 weeks ago. Everything has been operating without problem and there have been no detectable leaks around the water connections into and out of the water heater. However, I discovered what could be some corrosion starting on the hot water side. The connection is a stainless steel flex pipe without tape or compound (the pipe's tag said not to use any). I believe the hot water side connections are galvanized steel. </p>

<p>Is it possible for corrosion to form so quickly and if so what should I do about it? My first thought was to disconnect, cleanup, and try again with a new line. How quickly should I act?</p>

"Protecting multiple outlets with one GFCI; is it possible with this wiring scheme? <p>I have a family-room circuit with 5 outlets and a one-year-old who thinks it's funny to try to stick things in them. So I thought it would be a good idea to add GFCI protection (and tamper resistance). I know that in theory you only need <a href=""http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/41820/one-gfci-outlet-to-protect-them-all"">one GFCI box to protect the whole circuit</a>, the trick is to determine which receptacle is farthest upstream and replace that one, making sure you get line vs. load correct. So my plan was this: take all five boxes out of the wall, disconnect and separate the wires, flip the breaker back on, and walk around with my non-contact voltage tester looking to see which black wire still has voltage on it, implying it is the most upstream. Well, it turned out that when I did this, every single black wire at every single outlet still had voltage. I'm sure this wasn't a false positive because none of the white wires triggered the tester. I take this to mean that there is one main wire that circles the perimeter beneath the floor, and right below each outlet there must be a junction box with a separate wire going up to the receptacle. Is my reasoning correct, both regarding how to find the first receptacle and what it means that the technique didn't work? If so, does it imply that I can't protect this circuit by replacing a single receptacle, and would need to either install a new outlet farther upstream or use a GFCI breaker instead?</p>

"Fixing a running toilet <p>I have a toilet that runs periodically, like maybe half the time after a flush. For what it's worth, it's not a constant run, but rather the water kicks on every 5 minutes or so to top off the tank.</p>

This keeps up for maybe another 2-4 seconds when I stop urinating. Could the increase of liquid in the bowl be overflowing into the tank or some other body of water?</strong> Not sure if that oddity would provide any help in diagnosing the problem or not, but thought I'd throw it in there. </p>

"Ceiling-fan switch no longer turns off fan <p>I've been installing new outlets and switches in a condo my wife and I recently bought.The old ones were fine, but the wrong color. I've been replacing like for like, swapping the older Leviton beige switches for newer white ones. I've replaced single pole switches with single poles, 3-ways with 3-ways, and 4-ways with 4-ways. And I've tried in all cases to connect the existing wires in each box to the same terminals on each new switch. (I'm an extreme novice when it comes to electrical work.) The problem I'm having is with a 3-gang switch group in the family room. The right-hand dial is a rheostat control for the chandelier in the room... Pushing it in turns it on and off and spinning it varies the brightness. It's working OK (probably because I didn't touch it; I just substituted the existing beige knob for the white one in the photo...; - ) The middle switch is SUPPOSED to turn the ceiling fan on/off, and it did before I changed the switch. Now the ceiling fan is on all the time; toggling the switch does nothing. The only way I can now turn the fan off is either flipping the breaker which controls the circuit the fan is on or standing on a chair and pulling on the fan's chain. (It's a fan-only ceiling fan; there is no light fixture on it.) The left switch also turns the chandelier on/off. I don't think it did this before I messed with these switches; I'm guessing it was just linked to a switched outlet, but I haven't gotten that far yet.</p>

<p>When I pulled the left &amp; middle switches out of the box, installed the new switches and reconnected the wires, I obviously miswired something because that's when the fan stayed on constantly (and when - I think but am not positive - the left switch also started turning the chandelier off/on. Note that both switches are single-pole and each is connected to three wires. The middle switch (the one which used to control the fan but now does nothing) has 1 red &amp; 2 black wires and the left switch has 3 black wires. Any help/suggestions sincerely appreciated. I have several good photos I could attach but this forum apparently doesn't provide a mechanism for inserting/attaching photos, at least I couldn't immediately find a way to do it.</p>

"Three Way Dimmer switch not working with track light <p>I have a three way dimmer switch at base of stairs and a three way switch at top of stairs that controls a track light at top of stairs. The wiring on the dimmer is just one cable coming into the dimmer with common wire, two travelers, and ground.  The wiring at the switch at top of stairs is the same.

The remaining white/black/ground are hooked up to the track.  </p>

<p>My problem is the track lights won't turn on.  The original chandelier that was there worked.  I tested the track with lights with a plug in adapter and it worked fine.  The dimmer and switch are both new, with same wires attached as they were before.  The track is reading 98v at both the connecting screws and copper rail (120v line), and the single bare black wire attached to track reads the same.  I tested each spot figuring maybe it's the connector.  The switch wiring is anywhere from 35v to 98v depending on wire.  The dimmer is turned up all the way, and varies voltage like it should.  The dimmer wiring is reading 120v on the common, making me think that is coming from the pigtailed black wires in light box.  Lastly, the pendants that are hanging on the track have no voltage reading in the sockets.  These work fine though when plugged in to a wall with the track adapter.</p>

I've cut circular hole into a slightly larger rectangle. I plan on positioning a piece of wood behind the hole and covering it up with a block of drywall and sealing it up with mud.</p>

"How to hang a TV on a drywall with no studs and no room for toggle bolts? <p>I am hanging a TV in a narrow wall space that has no studs behind it.  I have verified there are no studs behind the drywall by using two different stud finders (a cheaper and a more expensive model).  Both devices did go off once, but only in a small area in the middle of the wall, not along the whole height, so it's definitely not a stud.</p>

<p>This TV mount requires 4 screws.  The original plan was to use 4 toggle bolts (a.k.a. drywall screws).  However, after pre-drilling the holes, I found that there is another hard surface that begins about 1.5 inches after the drywall.  There is no room for the ""butterfly"" part of the toggle bolt to open up.  I don't know what the hard surface is.  When I give it a knock with a screwdriver, it sounds like either metal or brick.  This is an apartment building over 100 years old.  There is another person's apartment behind the wall.  A few questions:</p>

<p>1) Should I do additional testing to find out if that surface is brick or metal?  If so, how?</p>

<p>2) If not, should I assume it's brick and proceed with trying to put the screws into the brick, either directly or with anchors?  What kind of additional gear would this require?  Special screws, drill bits, anchors?</p>

<p>3) Alternatively, should I stick with the toggle bolt method, which would require drilling large openings in the second surface to allow for sufficient clearance for the toggle bolts to open?  Not sure how easy this would be.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"How to get heating system working again? <p>We have an oil-fired boiler that does both the hot water and the forced hot water baseboard heating system.</p>

<p>It was unusually cold and windy last night here in north-central Massachusetts.  I turned down the thermostat before going to bed as usual.  Apparently one or more blockages froze in the main floor loop during the time it was cooling down before the thermostat called for heat again.  By morning the circulation pump was constantly running, but nothing was flowing thru the main floor loop.  The upstairs loop was working fine.</p>

<p>Using hair dryers and a heat gun, I think all the pipes were warmed to melt any ice in them.  This also happened 25 years ago, and at that time I created small pinhole taps at a few points in the loop where it is accessible in the basement.  These were for relieving pressure, and to see where the ice blockages were.  I opened these taps, and initially just a short burst came out.  After clearing the ice blockages, a steady stream came out as expected.</p>

<p>However, after a little while water stopped flowing and air was getting sucked into the one tap hole left open about midway thru the loop.  Now both loops seem to not have water in them, and the top floor is no longer getting heat (the loop that never froze).  I can see that the circulating pump running constantly, and no water comes out of the valves when opened just above the zone valves by the boiler in the basement.</p>

<p>Two questions:<ol></p>

<p><li>How do I get the heat working again?</p>

<p><li>How is water supposed to replace any leaked out of the heating system, or get in there in the first place?  I assumed there was a one-way valve someplace that lets normal house water into the heating system, but apparently not.  I looked at the spaghetti plumbing by the boiler and think I figured out what each pipe does, but I see no obvious connection from the water system to the heating system.  Perhaps this is hidden inside the boiler unit?</p>

"Do I need to trim the dishwasher drain line to prevent water build-up from the disposal? Also are elbows OK here? <p>We replaced the sink recently, which required taking off the disposal and installing it on the new sink, and also re-doing the plumbing since the new sink's drain would be further back than the previous one.</p>

<p>For maybe two days we had everything hooked up except for the dishwasher drain line to the disposal, which required a part that was in an unexpected part of my local HD store...so I finally got it on my third trip there.</p>

<p>Anyway, I installed the Insinkerator drain coupler which is a rubber reducer going from the dishwasher outlet on the disposal, to the DW drain line. Two questions:</p>

<p>(1) My DW drain line is really long. Currently, it goes from a hole near the bottom of the sink cabinet, up to a clamp beneath the counter (high loop), but then there's enough excess for it to go all the way down to the sink cabinet floor, then back up to the disposal. When we temporarily had everything attached except this connection, we discovered that, past some level of water (collecting in the disposal before draining), water could back up out of the disposal and spill out at the DW connection. This makes me fear that water will come out of the disposal and could take up the long ""low"" loop that goes down to the floor and then back up to the clamp under the sink. Any down sides to this? Should I cut it shorter?</p>

<p>(2) We installed the sink in a corner cabinet, and the cabinet is designed so that instead of going all the way back into the corner, it's cut off, making a 90-45-45 triangle of wasted space. As a result, quarters are close, and the DW drain line connection to the disposal is cramped. Should I install some sort of elbow in between? Right now it's a rubber reducer connected to a rubber DW hose on one side, and the plastic disposal outlet on the other. I don't like clamping rubber to rubber, so maybe a plastic or metal elbow would be good...thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

"What is the best way to incrementally finish an unfinished basement? <p>my wife and I are in the process of buying our first house. The house has a 750 square foot unfinished basement (cinderblock walls and concrete floor), and is brand new (rather, it will be brand new when it is finished in a week or two). We don't have the option of having the contractors finish the basement for us because we are using a program for first time home buyers, but we would like to finish the basement within the first two years that we live there. Unfortunately, we have received a quote of $30,000 - $45,000 to finish the basement. What we would like to do instead of tackling the whole project at once is to tackle the project in smaller, more affordable pieces. Here is what we would like to see accomplished:</p>

<ul>
<li>We would like to convert the basement into 4 smaller spaces (with walls)</li>
<li>We would like to run electrical outlets every several feet throughout the outer walls (I am a bit of an electronics nut)</li>
<li>We would like to insulate the outer walls and hang drywall</li>
<li>We would like to install some kind of flooring (I am hoping for hardwood as adding hardwood to the whole house is my next major project for the house)</li>
<li>I suppose we need to add some sort of drop ceiling, but I am not sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is compound. First of all, is there any major pitfall to doing this project incrementally that I may not have thought of? The second part is which order would be best for tackling these projects. Lastly, Which parts of this project should I (as a not terribly handy person) attempt to take on by myself in order to maximize my savings while taking on the least risk of screwing the job up?

"NM-B insulation repair? <p>I'm doing some work up in my attic, installing plywood decking over my garage for storage.  During installation, I accidentally rubbed the edge of one plank of plywood against a run of NM-B, tearing its outer insulation.  (The inner paper-like sheath is not damaged.)</p>

<p>If both ends of this run of NM-B were accessible I would just replace it completely.  Unfortunately, it is the line running from my garage's overhead light, to the light switch mounted on the wall.   I'm pretty certain this run will be stapled to the stud, a few inches above the switch gang, which means I can't pull it out.  (It is also inaccessible for other reasons, such as: the point at which it descends through the plate down to the switch gang is directly below my A/C unit, in the attic.)</p>

<p>Since neither the paper sheath nor the insulated conductors inside were damaged, I'm wondering if it would be acceptable (NEC-wise) to just wrap electrical tape around the scarred portion.  After the repair, this section will be hidden under the plywood decking that I am installing.  (Not intentionally, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.)</p>

"How can I join two solid surface vanity tops for a seamless appearance? <p>I purchased two Swanstone solid surface vanity tops for my double-bowl sink.  I trimmed them to site side-by-side and planned to use white silicone caulk between them to fill any very small gaps.  They looked fine going in but the caulk sunk some after it dried and so I am thinking I need to take one out and fill the gap with something else that will have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-porouos</li>
<li>Easy to clean</li>
<li>Same or similar color as my tops</li>
<li>Will bond to solid surface</li>
</ul>

<p>I have considered epoxy of some sort, but I'd like to know if there is anything that is commonly used to this effect.  I have seen granite tops lined up with little noticeable seam so I think it should be possible.  Of course, I should have picked a darker color to hide the seam better but... live and learn I guess.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gsoEX.jpg"" alt=""Vanity tops""></p>

<p>UPDATE:
I received a response from Swanstone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, Corian can be chemically bonded but Swanstone cannot. We do a
  mechanical  bond and then fill seams with an acrylic glue. These
  products are only available to certified swanstone fabricators. If you
  would like information on that, give me your location and I can tell
  you who to get in touch with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already have a mechanical fastening system in place, not pictured are three 1/4""x20 bolts in the front, back, and middle of the sink spanning the vertical supports of the two halves, which happen to butt against each other.</p>

<p>Update: I followed Jack's advice and used glacier white SeamIt brand solid surface adhesive (2 part epoxy).  The results are not bad, the only downside is that the adhesive itself has a different sheen than the swanstone so I think I'll try to rough it up later to cut down on reflections off of the adhesive line.

"How do wire this 2-gang dimmer switch? <p>I'm trying to fit a dimmer switch in my living room. I have two pendent lights controlled by a single wall socket with two switches one for each light. My property is a new build and in the UK.</p>

<p>So much for thinking this would be as easy as unwiring the wires and wiring them into the same places on the new dimmer switch!</p>

<p>My current standard wall socket is wired like so:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mINR6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mINR6.jpg"" alt=""wiring before I changed the socket""></a>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aVur.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5aVur.jpg"" alt=""wiring before I changed the socket""></a></p>

<p>This seems a lot more complicated than just a few wires to swap. There appear to be multiple cables coming out from the wall. The Green/Yellow earth is loose in the backplate with a plastic end cap.</p>

<p>The wires in L1 and Com on the first switch are striped towards the end of the wire, the stripped part is then in the L1 or Com socket and then the end of that wire is then kind of bridged into the other L1 or Com socket on the other switch.</p>

<p>My new 2-gang 400W dimmer looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vLAA8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vLAA8.jpg"" alt=""SMJ WAD2GC 2-gang 400W dimmer switch""></a></p>

<p>Problem is new dimmer switch does not have a socket labeled <em>N Loop</em>.
I tried replicating the wiring but where on the original sockets the wires are in the N (Loop) ports, I've just put them in L2 on the new socket as that was the only other port unused. </p>

<p>It seems the old switch has Com, N (Loop), L1 and L2 ports, but the new dimmer socket only has L1, L2 and Com.</p>

<p>I tried this setup and it kind of worked if lights were on and the lights did dim (though flicked, maybe wrong energy bulbs) but when I tried to turn them off they blow trip the fuse in the main fuse box.</p>

<p>As you can probably tell I know nothing about wiring or these kind of things. Any help or pointers anyone could give me would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>I was wondering if I have the wrong type of light switch but I can't find any other types.</p>

<p>I've also included a photo of the instructions though they don't really mean much to me and don't really correspond to the original wiring for the original socket.</p>

"Is it possible to notch framing studs for installing conduit w/out structure collapsing? <p>I have a garage which is a simple structure - 4 walls, garage door, and a normal door.

"How Can I move an old galvanized pipe <p>I'm remodelling my bathroom. The tub needs to be pushed back about 2in against the wall but an old pipe is in the way. I think it is no longer being used.

"I need to Mount a 55"" Sony TV on a Wood paneling wall w/no studs <p>My wife and I rent a duplex in an old neighborhood of Honolulu, HI. We have talked about mounting our 55"" XBR-55X810C Sony 4K TV since we bought it, and yesterday we bought a mount on a whim. It's a Stanley tilting mount for 32"" up to 70"" TV's up to 90 pounds in weight. The XBR-55X810C specs say it's 38.2 pounds. Here is a link to the mount: <a href=""http://www.stanleymounts.com/tlr-es2215t-product-page.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanleymounts.com/tlr-es2215t-product-page.html</a></p>

<p>But unfortunately, everything made sense after a wasted trip to the HW store to buy a $15.99 stud finder, and that was, the walls are thin pieces of wood paneling without studs the tilting mount instructions call for. Umm, probably should have added that up when we realized the electrical sockets throughout most of the electrical outlets are facing sideways on the baseboards, and the light switches have electrical running on the outside of the wall into the ceiling (pictures attached).</p>

<p>The wall is located between our LR and MBR; and there is no view to see what's inside, checked the breaker and ground, but there is a ceiling crawl space in the bathroom I can can look. </p>

<p>To measure the thickness I measured the inside of the door jam (3 4/16""), and subtracted the measurement of each outside edge of the jam to the wood paneling to the wood paneling on both sides, subtracting the outside doorjam overhang on each side and taking it away from the initial measure (inside measurement - (1 11/16"" + 12/16"") 2 7/16"" = 13/16"" of thickness, in total, for both sides of the wood paneling which is surprisingly sturdy and holds sound quite well.  </p>

<p>I searched the DIY site before typing this all out and couldn't find the exact scenario, so I am hoping that a few kind users could offer me advice on how I could make this mount work, given the layout of the room, having no other mounting options (except for maybe a floor standing mount). </p>

<p>So if there is a reasonable way for a DIY novice like myself to safely install the TV with minimal damage to the wall, then I am all ears and would be so appreciative. </p>

<p>The wall plate hardware includes are 4 lag bolts with washers, and concrete anchors. The directions say to drill 3 inch pilot holes into studs which have no less than a total depth of 3 1/2 inch, with a 3/16"" bit. </p>

"Possible cross over issue with water lines <p>About 2 weeks ago our hot water started getting less and less hot, now it is completely cold. If I turn the cold angle stop off at the sink, so only the hot water line can feed the faucet, and turn it on, water flows. If I turn it to the completely hot setting water flows, but if I turn it to the completely cold setting the water stops. (No crossover in the faucet). Here is the tricky part, if I turn off the cold water feed to the hot water heater, with the faucet on hot only, the water will still run. This happens in all of my sinks except one. In the hookup closest to the hot water heater, if I hook the hose to the hot water angle valve and turn it on, HOT water flows out. If I then turn off the supply to the hot water heater, the flow stops (as it should). Only this one sink functions this way. When this is happening I can hear the water being taken out of the hot water heater, and new water being put in. When I turn on any other faucet it is not even trying to draw water out of the hot water heater, even if I have the cold angle valve on the faucet turned off (so it can only draw from the hot circuit). Also, I turned off the angle valves to the dishwasher and washer/dryer for all the tests.</p>

<p>To summarize, the faucet closest to the hot water heater works flawlessly. All other faucets will only run cold. When the cold water angle valve is turned off, and the faucet is turned onto hot, water runs, but is cold, and is not even trying to draw from the hot water heater. Everything seemed to work fine 2 weeks ago, and no plumbing has been tampered with.</p>

I was planning to do this as part of running wiring for three 100-amp subpanels from a 200-amp main.</p>

"Help decipher this wiring <p>I am trying to put a flourescent light fixture into our pantry into an existing fixture/junction box. The previous light was taken down by some previous help I had and they had made a couple of comments about the wiring. They aren't here now, but I am ready to put up my new light. To the best of my knowledge, this fixture is just controlled with one light switch. This is an older house and during this kitchen remodel, we have found several old locations under the drywall where previous switches were. However, the wiring into this box all looks new from the time the house was gutted in 1997. But we have only ever used one switch to control the light.</p>

<p>Here is the description of what is coming in:
Three cables are coming in. Each cable is two wire (white, black, ground).
G1 + G2 + G3 are connected.
B1 + B2 + W3 are connected.
W1 + W2 are connected.
B3 is by itself (capped).</p>

<p>The light switch just has one cable to it.</p>

<p>Just trying to sort out what might be happening up there. I'll probably need to get up in the attic and see if I can determine where the other cables go.</p>

"Need help wiring switches with several wires <p><strong>Background:</strong> This started out as a simple addition of a recessed light in a hallway.  The beginning issue was that the wire to power it was live all the time.  So I took apart the switches in ""Box 1"" by my front door.  Having little electrical knowledge, I found myself quickly over my head which landed me here.</p>

<p><strong>The Setup:</strong> I have Box 1 which contains 4 switches and 5 wires (each with a live and neutral).  I have Box 2 which contains one switch for my living room which works independently of the switches in Box 1.  Currently there is no power to the wire for the recessed light and none of the other switches work as they've been disassembled.  I'm having trouble figuring out how to get them back together and make everything work again.  That's where I'm hoping DIY can give me a hand and school me on DIY home electrical work.</p>

<p><strong>The Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Have the recessed light be on it's own switch.</li>
<li>Have one switch for the porch light, garage light, and lamp post light.  There were 4 switches previously so I want to cut it down to two.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Current Knowledge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Service Box wire will trip the breaker if I connect the live to the neutral.</li>
<li>The Garage wire will trip the breaker if I connect the live to the neutral.</li>
<li>The Lamp Post Light wire will turn on the light if I connect the live to the neutral.</li>
</ul>

<li>Klein Tools MM100 Multimeter</li>
<li>Klein Tools Voltage Tester</li>
<li>Commercial Electric VAC/DC MS8900H Tester</li>

"Furnace keeps resetting <p>My trane xr90 furnace keeps resetting just while it 
is in its ""heat up phase"" I'm a laymen but a description of what is happening is like this...
The furnace gets a call for heat, it makes a sound and lights up near the burners, when the burners start to heat up it makes a ""whisk"" sound an restarts the process. This continually happens soon after the burners begin to heat up and before the fan begins to blow the warm air into the ducts. The filter is new, the red light is blinking fast and steady (when it is calling for heat). Sometimes if I switch off the breaker and reset it will work once or twice and then start failing again.

"How can I correct the slope of a marble shower sill? <p>Our master shower is tiled in marble; it's <em>almost</em> perfect except... the sill has a slight slope running out of the shower instead of into it.  As a result, every time we take a shower, a small amount of water runs out and down the front face of the sill, and (if not wiped up promptly) soaks into the floor.</p>

<p>The glass door (which swings in and out) is centered on the sill, and has a plastic deflector at the bottom, so the amount of water is not huge; it's on the order of a teaspoon to a tablespoon each shower.  Still, it's enough to have destroyed the molding and required the replacement of a few floorboards, and the replacements are already showing damage.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/P8cgv.jpg"" alt=""Pardon the low-quality cellphone pic""></p>

<p>I'd like to reverse that slope so that water drains <em>into</em> the shower rather than out of it; I suspect that the best method would involve removing the tiles from the sill and re-seating them.  I'm not really up for that, though, so I was thinking more along the lines of polishing the inner edge (very slightly) and building up the outside (very slightly) with some sort of polish or wax.  Another idea was to make a small dam of transparent/""invisible"" silicone caulk in a line just under where the door hangs when it's closed; my concern with that approach is that 1) invisible caulk really isn't; 2) we would feel it underfoot; 3) it would tend to peel up and need replacing relatively quickly, and until it was replaced it might be worse than the current situation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with a similar situation, and/or suggestions?  Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
It's a bit embarrassing (it's the sort of thing you'd think I should have noticed long ago), but when I really took a look I realized that the plastic bit at the bottom had disappeared some time back.  I'd simply got used to it being gone, and didn't make the connection between its disappearance and the wet-floor problem.</p>

"Is this ceiling box wiring correct and how can I reconnect an abandoned 3-way switch to it? <p>I have a house (Georgia, USA) and some kitchen renovations have revealed some prior electrical work and I am trying to figure it out.  Originally, there was a ceiling box in the kitchen with a fan/light fixture controlled by a pair of 3-way switches.  One 3-way switch was located at the kitchen entrance to the garage and the other switch was located in a 2-gang box that it shared with a 2-way switch for a ceiling light in the dining area.  The fan and light did not have separate switches.</p>

<p>At some point in the past, an exterior flood light was added to the house and the 3-way switch in the 2-gang box was replaced with a duplex switch.  One switch controls the light fixture and the other controls the exterior flood light.  The 3-way switch at the garage entrance was abandoned and covered with a cover plate.  And by abandoned, I mean the 'electrician' bent back the tabs on the switch and shoved the entire switch into the box).  The overall layout looks like this:<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ELiRf.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ELiRf.png"" alt=""schematic showing wiring layout""></a></p>

<p>While renovating the kitchen, I found that the fan was mounted to a shallow fan-rated box with wiring from it to a second non-fan-rated box that was just laying on the insulation in the attic.  I removed the ceiling fan and the boxes (mentally noting how it was all wired) intending to rewire it (using a properly sized single box) the following day.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, the work was delayed several weeks and I cannot remember the exact wiring.  I spent a couple of hours with my multimeter checking continuity to determine which wire was connected to what and I think that the kitchen ceiling box and 2-gang switch box looked something like this:<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLkzA.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLkzA.png"" alt=""picture of ceiling box and wall box wiring""></a></p>

<p>The 2-gang switch box on the right is exactly as I found it.  The wires from the 3-way switch were sitting at the back of the box, unterminated with bare conductors exposed.  The neutral was connected to the black unterminated pigtail with a wire nut as shown.</p>

<p>The ceiling box on the left is how I think it should be wired, with one exception.  Note that there is black tape shown on the neutral going to the sink light switch.  This switch is not a 3-way switch so I think that the black tape is a mistake.  The hot from the ceiling box goes to the switch which then sends it to the light fixture.  The neutral from the light fixture should connect with the neutral from the ceiling box in the switch box and all the neutrals are connected together in the ceiling box as shown.</p>

<p>Having said all that, there are three parts to my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the ceiling box wiring look correct (taped neutral notwithstanding)?</li>
<li>Should I remove the tape from the neutral?</li>
<li>Can I replace the 2-way duplex switch with a 2-way/3-way duplex switch and reconnect the 3-way circuit?  If so, how is the 3-way switch wired at each end?  If not, how do I properly abandon the 3-way cable at each end?</li>
</ol>

<p>My current plan is to implement the answer provided by A. I. Breveleri with the minor change recommended by RedGrittyBrick to make the constant hots black and the switched hots red. So the final result, if I'm not mistaken, will look like this:<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rdS.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4rdS.png"" alt=""new wiring plan""></a></p>

<p>If there are no objections, I'll wire it up this way and mark A. I. Breveleri's answer correct after the lights are on.</p>

<p>Also, in working on this problem I visited many sites that attempted to explain 3-way switches, but the only explanation that made the light bulb go on in my head was <a href=""http://www.how-to-wire-it.com/wiring-a-3-way-switch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>:</p>

<p>""What is common in the diagrams above and with any 3-way switch circuit is that the power hot wire coming into the circuit will always go to the common terminal of the first switch. The hot wire from light always goes to the common terminal of the second switch. The traveler wires go from switch to switch connected to the traveler terminals, it doesn't matter which. As long as you keep this in mind, a 3-way circuit becomes really simplified. And of course the neutral will always go directly to the load.""</p>

"What is correct vapour barrier method for bathroom ceiling in a bungalow in Canada <p>I am in the middle of a complete main floor bathroom gutting and re-finish job in my house in CANADA.. and WINTER IS COMING!!!!</p>

<p>THE BACKGROUND (pics below):</p>

<p>My bathroom is 5'x 13' in a bungalow with 2x6' outside construction walls with Fiberglass batt insulation in the walls, and blown cellulose insulation in the attic. My house has been a very energy efficient and almost perfectly sealed home built in 1985.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be well versed with applying the proper rated vapour barrier to the outside walls using proper vapour-barrier/acoustic sealant (black tar of death) and stapling properly to have a PERFECT air-tight vapour barrier against our crazy -40C/F winters..  I even know about the Tuct-Tape work required to seal joins and overlap edges of separate sheets of poly, etc.</p>

<p>... However.. when I took down the old popcorn drywall ceiling (after i moved over all the cellulose insulation so it wouldn't fall in)..  I noticed the original vapour barrier was ONLY stapled up to the rafters with the 5/8"" drywall screwed/nailed through it... the bathroom ceiling vapour barrier had NO BLACK sealant along the edges, so it was not 100% air/vapour sealed to the attic.</p>

<p>THE QUESTION:</p>

<p>Since i'm NOT doing popcorn ceiling again, should I apply black-sealant as well to the ceiling sheets of vapour barrier just like I will do to the outside wall to create a perfect seal??</p>

<p>I have read some stories that because proper attics (like mine is) has natural air-flow its OK for a small amount of warm-air to get into the attic because the natural airflow will vent the moisture!!  Is this TRUE? or would i be creating a condensation disaster in the making?</p>

"How do I wire my furnace humidifier so it comes on any time the fan is on? <p>I have an Aprilaire 600a humidifier from a few years ago and currently it's wired into my furnace with two control wires labeled ""W/G"" and ""Cf"".  The ""W/G"" is connected to the W terminal on the furnace (call for heat).  The ""Cf"" is connected to ""C"".

<p>The black lead comes in and is directly spliced to the outgoing black lead with a wire nut.  It is not connected to the GFCI at all.</p>

<li>Is this wired correctly, and if not, how do I rewire it so that it is?</li>

"What information about a house is required to get a quote for a fire sprinkler retrofit? <p>So, I have the crazy idea to give my grandparents what could be the ultimate Christmas present -- having their house (they own it outright) retrofit with fire sprinklers.  It's a single-story ranch with a one-car attached garage and full basement of about 1100ft^2 finished area, fed by municipal water -- so on the face of it, a retrofit appears feasible.  However, the house was built in 1947 -- so there are no blueprints for it.  What information, other than a reverse-engineered floorplan of the rooms of course, would the sprinkler contractor need for a quote on the retrofit?</p>

"Sewer Smell in Sumps <p>I recently bought a house with two sump pumps in the basement. They do their job well despite running every hour or two due to the high clay table in the area. The property also has a septic system, but we will soon (within a week or so) be connecting to the new public sewer.</p>

<p>Last night, I noticed my sump pumps were kicking on very frequently - about every 5 minutes. When I went down to investigate, I was hit with a wall of sewer-gas smell emanating from both sumps. The smell is now taking over the house at night, so I've had to shut off the AC and open the windows. Now, my first assumption is an issue with the septic system. Would it be wise to wait until we connect to public sewer (and the septic is pumped) to verify my theory, or is there something else I should try in the meantime? Thanks for your time!</p>

"How should I wire 2 switches that control 1 light and 1 receptacle? <p>Last winter I pulled power into an attic. I put in a 2 gang box with 2 switches. One switch controls a light in the attic and works fine. The second controls an outlet and I realized months later that power is always on, the switch has no affect.</p>

<p>I had used some wiring books and made up the wiring diagram myself, so I'm guessing I have something wired incorrectly? I have black, white and ground in the power coming in and power to light and black, red, white and ground in the power to the switched outlet. If I need to pull the outlet to diagram how it's wiring I can do that. Here is what I have in the box for the switches:<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sqZOQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Rental car insurance in Australia <p>My wife and I intend to spend 2 weeks in Australia and to rent a car for most of that period. We will be travelling in the country between Sydney - Canberra - blue mountains - Sydney. We do not expect to be travelling anywhere expected to be overly rugged (and rental car agreements prohibit any unsealed road travel apart from short sections) but Australia being Australia 'anything can happen'.</p>

<p>On reading the fine print of the hire agreements of even the top comprehensive insurance cover along with all available waivers, offered by companies we have looked into, I find that you are not covered at all for underbody damage or immersion. Some don't cover roll over, windscreen breakage and tyres. Apparently 'comprehensive' has a different meaning in Oz? </p>

<p>[Relevantish aside: Last year we hired a Britz camper in Melbourne via a 3rd party re-renter. (Most Britz vans get rented that way - cheaper than Britz - you actually deal with Britz and never meet the ""renter'. We drove it to Alice Springs via various interesting places. They offered comprehensive no-surprises insurance, no excess etc. I read the fine print. Single vehicle roll-over damage was excluded. I asked. Oh yes, you can have that for xxx extra. NO mention on their site or anywhere.  We asked how many single vehicle roll overs they had. ""Oh - maybe 4 to 6 a month - the vans tend to get caught in crosswinds."" We took the extra cover.]</p>

<p>At least one independent company offers ""comprehensive excess cover"" but in the list of extras that they do offer they do not mention immersion and when we contact them for clarification they seem to lose the ability to understand English. </p>

<p>We do not intend to immerse the car, damage the underbody, roll it, damage its tyres or break its windscreen. Except for the last we've not managed anything on that list in a rental car in many decades of occasional hire. [Descending blue mountains, full seal, left (curbside) lane - bang - no windscreen]. But if any of those things happens while we are behaving lawfully and sensibly, and in Oz they are not absolutely unlikely, we don't want an unexpected bill for $5,000 to $30,000, as is potentially possible. </p>

<p>Question:  What we'd like is a straight forward, no hidden now-you-pay-for-a-whole-new-car  surprises comprehensive insurance policy at a rate that is sensible given our record and experience. Any suggestions or comments. </p>

<hr>

<p>One only company whose fine print I read had a clause that required you to pay full daily rental at full rate including surcharges which would be irrelevant (eg 2nd driver, GPS if hired etc) for all days a car was off the road being repaired. Not covered by excess. Bye. </p>

<p>Train and MRT stations have bathrooms and some can be accessed without a ticket, but one this evening could not be accessed. One convenience store near here has one but all of the others I checked today did not have one.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had similar difficulty in Seoul, South Korea. But then I found out somewhere that they had a law that required buildings to permit public access to bathrooms. From that point I found I could wander into just about any random building in the city and find a bathroom on the ground or first floor landing.</p>

<p>So is there some trick to finding a toilet when needed in Taiwan too?</p>

"How do carpool lanes in the US work? <p>I'm doing some research for our roadtrip through SW USA (+Calif.) and ran into ""carpool lanes"" and this came to my attention: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hopefully if you're not travelling alone, you will be allowed to
  drive through carpool lanes that help go past single-occupancy
  traffic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we're travelling with 2 (and part of the trip with 4), is it safe to say I can always use the carpool lanes? If more than 2 (e.g. 3) persons are required, is there a clear traffic sign that states this or do I have to know the rules in each state/city by heart?</p>

<p>I also found that 2 freeways in LA County (I-10 and I-110) were converted to <a href=""http://www.infowars.com/carpool-lanes-in-los-angeles-turned-into-toll-roads/"">toll roads</a> and require RFID transponders. I suppose a rented car doesn't have a transponder? Is it made clear by any sign that you need a transponder?</p>

"Travel from Europe to Asia tickets <p>my family will be visiting me in Japan soon and we plan to make a trip to South Korea too. So they would be coming from France to Japan, then from Japan to Korea, then Korea to Japan and from Japan back to France.</p>

"Visa processing speed: VFS vs Embassy <p>I am applying for a Schengen Visa for Switzerland at London. To submit my application, I can choose to go to the VFS Visa Application Centre or the Embassy of Switzerland directly. I wonder which option would result in getting back my passport faster.</p>

<p>I know that the VFS Centre will deliver my application to the Embassy by the end of the day of my appointment, which means this method will be one day slower than going to the Embassy. However, the VFS Centre can return my passport using a courier, while the Embassy will only use regular postal service. If I collect in person, at VFS I can collect on the same day when my visa is processed, but at the Embassy I can only collect on the next day because the Embassy is only open in the morning.</p>

<blockquote>

  Please find the regulations regarding ticket refunds for each of your flights below. Remember that the most restrictive conditions of the fares that you bought will apply. In the event that you request a refund, we will deduct the highest penalty fee of the entire trip.</p>

  <li>Although your trip may not allow a refund you are entitled to request the return of the boarding fees. Please remember that in some countries there is a service charge and that this amount is not refundable.</li>
  <li>You can request ticket refunds in the Servicios de LAN.com section. For the fare: QLESPD6Y/DD20 of the family Base Refunds are permitted with a charge of US$200.00 .

The call center said something about that being the case if the ticket was originated in BR but since it originates in US it is non-refundable. I wonder what is the legal basis of this since everything from the web site where I bought the ticket to the receipt I got states the ticket is refundable with $200 fee.

Eventually it was widely recognised that a penning system (a <a href=""http://blog.lavi.com/2012/07/12/why-single-line-queuing/"" rel=""nofollow"">Single-Line</a> queue), or ticketing systems and such like, feeding all counters offered efficiencies.  </p>

<p>Check in counters at airports are sometimes run with penning systems or the equivalent, but only ever in my experience by a specific airline or that airline plus some affiliates. That often leaves long periods on some days where scores of counters are unmanned and with nobody waiting, while other areas may be heavily crowded with people waiting to check-in at a handful of counters. It is unlikely that all the counters would be in use at any one time given the number of passengers in a short time interval that would imply and the limitations of other facilities at the airport (Security, ground-handling tugs etc).  </p>

<p><em>Edit</em> This last is my misconception. See @Tom’s answer – at peak times <em>all</em> counters are used. (Subject to @SpaceDog's proviso re new airports.)</p>

<p>According to some <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/031714/why-airlines-arent-profitable-dal-ual-aal-luv-jblu.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">“The airline industry, in its history, has never made money.”</a> and though that is disputed, the industry is clearly very sensitive to costs <a href=""http://www.fzt.haw-hamburg.de/pers/Scholz/ALOHA/ALOHA_PUB_DLRK_09-09-08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">eg</a>. With that in mind, many airlines subcontract ground handling to airport owners, handling agents or even other airlines. <a href=""http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/ops-infra/Pages/ground-handling.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">More than 50% of the ground handling is outsourced</a> where ground-handling includes check-in counter services for departing PAX.  </p>

<p>Except perhaps for El Al Israel Airlines, the procedures for checking-in at any one airport (eg whether the exit fee, if any, has been paid) are similar for all international flights from that airport. The available technology (eg baggage handling) is the same and apparently staff may switch between counters (almost?) regardless of airline. So check-in services are a commodity with little differentiation other than the badge on the clerk or the banner behind the counter. </p>

<p>It is only curiosity (or perhaps something to do <a href=""http://meta.travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1837/competition-when-will-we-hit-10-000-questions"">with</a>?) but why are we wasting valuable real-estate by leaving it idle for quite long periods – and consequently causing passengers to queue longer than otherwise and presumably, somewhere down the line, charging them for the ‘privilege’?  </p>

<p>I’m guessing there <em>is</em> some technical reason, rather than merely a failure to agree commercial terms for a centralised service. Staff training is perhaps the most likely but does not convince me at present. I appreciate that shorter queues might not reduce the time between my arrival at the airport and my boarding my aircraft, but if it must be spent I'd rather do so in a Lounge.</p>

"Can I enter the UK as a UK citizen and resident on an Australian passport? <p>I'm about to travel to Europe and have misplaced my UK passport. I have an Australian passport which allows me entry to the the European countries in question without a visa.</p>

"ITALY: Missed the train due to wrong information provided by the seller <p>me and my wife are travelling from Munich to Venice.

<p>UPDATE: So it turned out to be Deutsche Bahn's problem, not Trenitalia's. After I contacted both of them and sent originals of the tickets to Deutsche Bahn office citing the EU regulation 1371, they finally reimbursed me the costs of the new tickets. DB said the costs of the original ticket is out of their responsibility, but rather should be resolved with Trenitalia. I don't really have a desire to pursue the matter further half a year later, but I definitely appreciate your advice!</p>

"What is the closest US equivalent to UK Ordnance Survey Maps? <p>In the United Kingdom, we have very detailed mapping available via the government-run Ordnance Survey.

<p>My instinct has been to respond to being greeted in the local language with a clear English reply of ""Good morning"" or similar, but for some reason it feels rude to me to not respond with an appropriate greeting in kind.</p>

<p>Do I just need to get over myself and just respond to (for example) 'Anyoung Haseo' with 'Hello'?</p>

"Need some advice from the pros about interrailing around Europe! <p>I am going interrailing with two of my friends (all of us are 21 years old and male- if that helps?) from the end of July to mid August. We are getting the 22 day global pass and are actually starting in Barcelona as we have got cheap flights to get there. Although it is only 22 days pass that doesn't include 3 nights in barcelona (as we are not using the pass til we leave there as we wont be using it in Barca); so we will be going for 25 days. The route is:</p>

<p>Barcelona</p>

<p>French Riviera</p>

<p>Milan</p>

<p>Munich</p>

<p>Prague</p>

<p>Berlin</p>

<p>Amsterdam</p>

<p>Brussels</p>

<p>London (Home).</p>

<p>The plan is to stay 2 or 3 nights in each city. None of us have done the whole travelling thing before and so don't quite know what is right and wrong in terms of money and what to take (how much clothing, do we take a lot of cash or rely on card machines, etc). One of the main issues that I have is the amount of money I am going to need. I think I can get around £1700 (after plane and interrail tickets) in money to take on the trip. So obviously that has to cover everything, from accommodation to food to going out. So that should give me about £68 a day.. Is that going to be enough in the places we are going? What are the places on the list that will cost me most? Obviously we will be drinking, etc in the nights and sightseeing during the day, so I am worried this won't be enough money. I am assuming that barcelona, french riviera and milan will be the big hitters in terms of alcohol costs and accommodation prices? Basically just asking you guys (and girls) for some guidance about money and what to expect to be spending for what in the places we are visting. Also any help on what I should pack (such as essential items that I wouldn't want to not have in my luggage) and how many sets of clothing, would also be very helpful.</p>

"Disability Laws By Country <p>I'm in the process of narrowing this down or formatting into about 5 different questions, leaving this as a more generalized question regarding laws similar to the ADA.  This shall serve as the Starter Question.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the comments.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Reasoning for Question</strong></p>

<p>I figured I'd post this section in opposition to all the negative comments I receive whilst I figure out a format for the multiple questions this idea I had will take.  I want this question to survive here for multiple reasons:</p>

<p><em>Reason 1</em>: It's been stated that I could Google for the answers I'm looking for regarding this idea of <em>Travel for the Disabled</em>, and while that's True, a Google Search will just spit out the laws etc that I'm looking for without the personal experiences of readers here, disabled or not.  </p>

<p>Example:  (I know it's not travel related, but keep reading)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/discrimination-at-work"" rel=""nofollow"">Discrimination at the Workplace | UK</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Google gave me the Law, but I want to know from someone's personal experience if the law is Skirted, i.e in my hometown we have 2 bowling alleys that are ADA compliant but the nuance here is that I can only go to the Accessible Bathrooms of each, but I can't bowl because there are no ramps to the lanes.  Technically, since the bathrooms are compliant, the buildings are, even though I've never bowled at either alley, as the alleys are skirting compliance.</p>

<p>How would anyone have known that those bowling alleys aren't compliant for disabled bowlers had I not told them through my experiences, as Google tells me in the Link to the ADA website that all buildings built after some certain date require accommodations?  Reading just that I would believe I could go bowling at any alley in the US, but these 2 I cant.   </p>

<p><em>Reason 2</em>: There is no Central repository based on personal knowledge relating to disabled travelers.  There are boatloads for able-bodied travelers.  If they exist for the disabled, it's not centralized, i.e. I don't want to Google for Country Tourism sites, and then correlate that with the law sites, and hope for the best... </p>

<h2>Importance</h2>

<p>Drawing from <a href=""http://travel.stackexchange.com/users/1893/jpatokal"">jpatokal's</a> link in his answer, and to quote Martin Heng:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was not travelling as I have known it, but it was enough to show
  me that undertaking a trip as a disabled person requires a lot more
  planning and preparation. Did I have enough medical supplies? What
  equipment did I need to take and what could be hired there? What were
  the airlines’ policies on luggage allowance and mobility equipment?
  Would the accommodation be as accessible as advertised? Would I be
  able to manage the bed and bathroom set-ups? Would I need to hire a
  van that would take my wheelchair or could I manage without? Gone were
  the days of stuffing as much as possible into a backpack and just
  getting on a plane with no fixed itinerary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>who continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wrong! There is quite a lot of information out there but it isn't easy
  to find – much of it is siloed in special-interest websites or hidden
  away on local government websites, often only in the local language.
  Recently a number of websites and mobile apps have sprung up that seek
  to fill this void, primarily by looking to the public to rate venues
  for their accessibility and provide reviews of accessible
  accommodation, restaurants and so on. However, most of these are quite
  local in nature – at the city or country level – and it's clear that
  the take-up has not yet been at a scale necessary to make them truly
  useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reason 1 and 2 fit both of these:  Telling me to Google defeats the purpose of information sharing, and I don't know the language if I'm planning, therefore I can't Google, much less read the localized site.  Stack Exchange was created to share information in these specialized areas for purposes as broad as disabled travel.  Yes the Topic is broad, but the group it applies to is in a minority, not only in the US, but in every country worldwide, therefore I ask for each country.  I don't mind correlating it in order to share it, but by doing it only once here, I decrease the planning required by disabled travelers, while making it easy to maintain.  Sure I could author a website, but then my information would be as ""silo'ed"" as all the others, which defeats the purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Current Laws</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I am a disabled citizen of the United States in my late 30's.  I suffer and deal with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"" rel=""nofollow"">Cerebral Palsy</a>, especially the section dealing with Self Care.  I have a college degree and work as a Programmer.  Before I die, as in on my bucket list, I would like to visit or live in a foreign country, and surely somewhere out there there are others who are in a similar situation to me who would like to do the same.  I'm asking this question because I want to know which countries have laws similar to The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990:(<a href=""http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Text</a>)|(<a href=""http://www.ada.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">Governmental Website</a>).  </p>

<p>I want this question to remain here as a source of information for all disabled visitors and readers, as there are no sources of information that are all in one place.  As such, after gathering Answers from readers, I will divide this question into different questions relevant by Topics, and Countries for future disabled travelers who Google for options.</p>

<p>As such, I'm asking you as readers to provide a paragraph or two answer relevant to the country you live in regarding the current law and statutes as it relates to your country's disabled citizens.  For obvious reasons, I'm excluding the US, and no correct answer will be given as of yet.  Please Provide Links, Quotes, etc relating to LAWS ONLY.</p>

"Schengen visa for separate 1-week travels with 3 months in-between <p>I am a student and I am going to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands in early September. I have the acceptance letter for my presentation at that conference. I will also attend a conference in early December in Spain. I haven't heard back yet from my submission to the second conference. Each conference spans about 1 week, and I will be in the States for the 3 months between them.</p>

<p>I have my appointment of Schengen visa application at the Netherlands consulate next week. The thing is, I don't want to make separate visa applications for each of Netherlands and Spain because it costs time and money (and patience). I know that a multi-entry Schengen visa can span 180 days.</p>

<p>So my first question is, if I submit the itinerary and hotel reservation for both conferences at my visa application, would the Netherlands consulate give me a 3-month or 6-month multi-entry Schengen visa although I will not be traveling and will be back home in the US between them? I want to note that I will not be able to present proof of invitation from the second conference since I haven't heard back from them yet.</p>

<p>My second (and probably the most important) question is, is there a possibility that the Netherlands consulate will directly reject my application because I ask for a multi-entry visa covering both destinations, so I lose the chance to attend even the first conference?</p>

<p>And my last question is, if they give me a 3-month visa, let's say that it expires on 3rd of December, can I enter Spain on 1st or 2nd of December, or do they require longer validity of the visa after the entrance?</p>

"Applying for a B2 visa after previous overstay as a child? <p>Background:</p>

"Tour or circuit to see different Melbourne neighborhoods? <p>We plan to spend a week in Melbourne near the end of May. Besides the usual recommended places for typical tourism, we are interested in visiting different neighborhoods in order to understand their relative differences, access to public transport, etc. The reason is that we plan to live there for a while later, and we'd like to get a ""feeling"" of the city and the suburbs to decide the best place to start.</p>

"How is Delta's MQM minimum per leg affected by fare class? <p>Under Delta's SkyMiles program (both the old one and the new one that began in 2015,) Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQMs) are earned per mile flown, but earn a minimum of 500 per leg. Additionally, the MQMs earned for a given leg are multiplied by 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 depending on the fare class. However, I'm not sure if the multiplier is applied before or after applying the 500 mile minimum. Their website seemed ambiguous on this point.</p>

<p>So, my question is: <strong>Is the fare class multiplier or the minimum applied first?</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if you fly 200 miles on a discount fare in business class (which has a 1.5x multiplier,) are the MQMs computed as:</p>

<p><code>maximum (500, 200 * 1.5) = 500</code></p>

<p>or as:</p>

<p><code>maximum (500, 200) * 1.5 = 750</code></p>

<p>Could, perhaps, someone who's flown Delta Business or First class since the beginning of 2015 on a leg of &lt; 500 miles check their SkyMiles statement to see how much mileage they were credited for the leg?</p>

"Appropriate clothing for Pantanal in Brasil during the dry season <p>We'll be traveling to the Pantanal in July this year. We'll start our trip in Cuiaba and will be traveling along the Transpantaneira. I think that at this time it will be the dry season.<br>

"In Malaysia, how should I deal with taxi drivers wanting to go off-meter? <p>I've been to Malaysia three times: once to Penang and twice to Kuala Lumpur. I mostly used taxis to get around, and I found that drivers always wanted to negotiate a fare up-front (which was much higher than a meter fare). Sometimes I could argue them into using the meter, but a few times (such as heading back from the KL zoo), they simply wouldn't take me unless I agreed to a flat rate.</p>

<p>At first, I thought they were scamming me for being a tourist. What I've heard, though, is that the law sets meter rates that are too low for the drivers to make a living, so going by the meter is simply not worth their time. I have no way of verifying that, though, and my gut reaction when someone tries to do this is that they're running a scam (this is the case in Thailand, where I was living at the time).</p>

<p>I'm thinking of Penang again next year. Does anyone have experience with this situation, and can you verify the cause? How trustworthy are drivers in KL and Penang in negotiating an honest fare, provided I don't let myself seem like an easy mark?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to clarify, I don't really have a problem paying drivers something they can live on; I just don't want to overpay/get swindled.</p>

  <p>Extra Security Measures taken at Airports
  Undergoing a full body scan at airports may not actually be the end of the airport security checks. If for some reason the scanner cannot make a full assessment of the passenger then a strip search may be necessary. Passengers will then be required to enter a private area where they will be asked to explain any abnormalities. If security officials are still not satisfied the passenger may be required to remove layers of clothing until the security officials are satisfied. Passengers do have the right for a body search to be made by members of the same sex.</p>

"Applying for a Schengen visa when there is a gap between trips to main destination and country of entry <p>Today I've applied for a Schengen visa to France in TLScontact centre in London. My first trip is in March to Netherlands for 3 days and the next one is in June to France for 6 days.<br>
My good friend suggested me to save money and to apply for the one Schengen visa that covers both trips in the Embassy of the Main destination country (which in my case is France).</p>

<p>However, today my application have been questioned by TLScontact. I've got a comment that there is a high risk that it could be failed and I won't get the visa at all. And the reason is that there is a gap of 1 month between the trips and the country of entry is not France but Netherlands. And the fact that I directly ask for the visa that covers both of my trips and provide all bought tickets and hotels reservations both in Paris and Amsterdam plays against me.<br>
I've been told that there are 3 possible outcomes for my case:<br>
<strong>1)</strong> I will get a visa since March, so I will be able to travel to Netherlands too.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> I will get a visa since June, and the document for the trip to Amsterdam will be simply ignored.<br>
<strong>3)</strong> The visa will be rejected and there is a high risk for this result.</p>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What do you think is a possible result I should be ready for? </p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Why would they reject my visa if I openly provide all the documents and everything is legal and clear?</p>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Is it possible that there could be different rules for the Embassies of different countries but which are in the same Schengen zone?</p>

<p><strong>Back story:</strong> My friend (also based in UK) followed the same procedure to travel first to Spain(4 days) and then to Poland (7 days) with the gap between the travels of 3 months!
When in Spanish Embassy she asked whether it was possible to get a longer visa since in 3 months after her trip to Spain she had a plan to go to Poland, she was suggested to apply via Polish Embassy because her stay in Poland supposed to be longer. There was no problems or comments in Polish Embassy and 2 weeks after she got her multiple-entry Polish Schengen Visa with the date of enter 3 months earlier than her supposed trip to Poland, just because she informed them about her planned trip to Spain. She was also told in both Embassies that if the gap between planned trips to Schengen countries doesn't exceed 3 months it's possible to apply for the multiple visa that covers both trips. And it has to be done via the Embassy of the Main country (with longest stay).</p>

This is an open one, but since we're only going to be there a short time, I'd like to see as many must-see things as possible. For example, passing by the Bellagio to see the fountain show, and possibly the Atlantis show at the other hotel. Is there some kind of guide to things you can see while making (for example) a long walk down the Strip?</p></li>

"Are governments limited in staff they can deploy to a consulate? <p>I've recently been dealing with the Russian consulates in North America, and they appear to be ridiculously mismanaged and/or understaffed.</p>

<p>In the jurisdiction served by Toronto, for example, they have so much ""population requiring consulate services"" that they not only have a queue to get in a queue (e.g. you have to set up an appointment to turn your papers in), but the aforementioned appointment queue is so full so far into the future (either 6 months or 1 year, IIRC) that their online queue management system currently doesn't even take any appointments at all whatsoever!</p>

I will be traveling by myself. My primary interest is to ski Alta, but were the logistics to work out such that it were easy, I might be interested to try other mountains in the area (Park City, etc.)</p>

<p>I would be flying into Salt Lake City. I've read up on the various transit options on the web (like UTA, private shuttle companies, etc) but I have no idea what it's actually like for skiers in the SLC and Park City areas to use these. In other words, is it feasible/pleasant to bring your equipment on public transit? I can see online that it is <em>allowed</em>, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea/pleasant experience. (Much like in my home town you can bring your bike on city buses, but by and large you'll wish you hadn't.) If at all possible, I would prefer to avoid renting a car (huge expense, not much use), but if doing so is going to make life/logistics substantially easier, I'm open to it.

"Are traveler's cheque widely accepted in Iran? <p>Due to the current <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._sanctions_against_Iran"">US embargo in Iran</a>, credit/debt cards using Visa/Mastercard circuit don't work there. One option in order not to bring large amount of cash in Iran would be to buy traveler's cheque but a search on the net revealed somewhat conflicting statements. For example, <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Iran"">Wikivojage</a> states that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Travellers' cheques</strong> All banks in provincial capitals are able to cash
  them, the paperwork is no longer needed to cash them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while the <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/iran/practical-information/money-costs"">Lonely Planet site</a> has quite a different view on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all intents and purposes, Iran is a purely cash economy. No credit
  cards. No travellers cheques. Just bring cold, hard cash – preferably

"In the UK, what rights do you have if a hotel is overbooked? <p>Today I had a pre-paid reservation for a hotel, booked a month or so back. They rang me to say they'd had a problem at the hotel, and were having to move a number of guests elsewhere as the rooms weren't available. The hotel they proposed moving me to wasn't nearly as nice (I was booked into a 4* hotel with a pool, they wanted to put me in a 3* with no gym, let alone pool). Oh, and the person I spoke to suggested that they'd keep the whole of my pre-payment in exchange for having found me an alternate lesser room!</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I pushed back on that. As I'd missed their initial call due to travelling, and was therefore the last to call back, when I made I fuss they managed to find me a room after all. On arrival, I had a chat with the duty manager, who was horrified that they hadn't offered to waive the charge, and has been amazing since. However, had I not been so forceful about the whole thing...</p>

Because I found an additional UK government document (see below) which appears to provide conflicting information to a UK government website. Any 'straight-from-the-horse's-mouth' experiences would be super valuable.</em></p>

<p>In trying to find out if I need a transit visa, I got the following list of conditions from the UK consulate website, meeting any of which would mean that I will not require a visa.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>are travelling <strong>to</strong> Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country <em>(does not apply)</em></p></li>
<li><p>are travelling <strong>from</strong> Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa <em>(This is what my query is about, see below)</em></p></li>
<li><p>are travelling to or from Australia and you have an Australian visa sticker in your passport - Australian e-visas and paper confirmation slips aren’t accepted by UK border control <em>(does not apply)</em></p></li>
<li><p>have a valid US permanent residence card issued on or after 21 April 1998 (or an I-797 extension letter issued by the Bureau of Citizenship if it’s expired) <em>(I do have I-797, but I don't have a permanent residence card either expired or unexpired)</em></p></li>
<li><p>have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002 <em>(does not apply)</em></p></li>
<li><p>have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA) <em>(does not apply)</em></p></li>
<li><p>have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state <em>(does not apply)</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now my query about 2) - I have a valid US visa, but its been <em>more</em> than 6 months since I last entered the country. So it appears that this shouldn't apply either. However, the rule seems absurd, since I can just go out of the country and come back (take a trip to Canada/Mexico etc), and that would make this rule applicable to me? So, I want to know if anyone here knows what is the interpretation of this rule in practice.</p>

"Are there still any ""cheap"" options for flying from Australia to Mexico without going through the US? <p>I've travelled to Mexico many times and I'm starting to feel the itch again but I think finding a cheap way there has become more difficult since my last trip 3 years ago.</p>

<p>I have some problems with US customs and immigration which makes getting a transit visa a serious pain so I cannot take any flight which stops on US soil, even to refuel. So all the obvious routes via Hawaii and California are out.</p>

<p>Another restriction is that I want a one-year ticket. It's much easier to find deals on two-week trips than long trips. Booking a few months in advance is not a problem however. Neither is having to travel within a small time window when the price is best.</p>

<p>The last few trips I've flown JAL via Tokyo and Vancouver and was very happy with the airline. I don't mind the long flights and I know how to turn a stop over into a feature of the trip.</p>

<p>But it seems JAL has cancelled this route since they've been haemorrhaging money and needed to make some cutbacks!</p>

<p>I've looked for other options but the airline comparison sites don't make it easy to add in the ""avoid USA"" parameter. I've looked at going via Canada, Santiago, Buenos Aires, and even London. But all these options work out about <strong>double</strong> my usual price of about $2,000! (AUD or USD are about the same right now)</p>

"Travel with violin Amtrak from Trenton NJ to Lancaster PA <p>Does anyone have experience taking musical instruments out of Trenton? My violin case just measures outside the sizing given on amtrak.com for medium-sized cases. What I want to avoid is getting to the train station, and then being forced to buy a second ticket because my case is two inches too long (all the other dimensions easily fit). Does anyone know how strict they may be about allowing it? It seems that I really shouldn't have a problem with the overhead space and such, and as far as I know, it's not a particularly busy train. I'll also be going from Indianapolis back to Trenton non-stop. I've done a lot of reading so far about cellos on Amtrak, but any violin-specific advice would be appreciated.</p>

"What is the ""MULT"" means? How can I use this visa for more than 2 entries to Schengen area? <p>I have applied for a tourist visa (first time) in the Netherland Embassy year 2012, I was given ""01"" entry  for 90 days and exit from Schengen area when my visa expired. After a year, I decided to apply again for a tourist visa, and unexpectedly granted a ""MULT"" which means I can go back to Schengen more than 2 entries. 
My visa is valid from June 6, 2014 - June 6, 2015 (1 year). I had my flight going to The Netherlands on June 9, 2014 and exit on September 6, 2014. I am a bit confuse about the ""180 days"" policy, which I really don't understand. If I will spend 90 days in Schengen and exit for 90 days before i will be able to go back, I can only consume my ""MULT"" entry for twice, because we only have 365 days in a year. My question is, What if I exit from Schengen 2 weeks before the end of my 90 days, and stay at my resident of country for only 2 weeks and re entry again?</p>

<p><strong>What countries belong to ""White Schengen list""?</strong> It must be about 57 countries, including Korea and Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong> Sorry for my poor wording. This is a single question, not two. And it is <em>not</em> about Annex II.

I'm asking for a list of (non-Schengen) countries who let <em>me, an Ukrainian</em>, enter on simplified rules based on the facts listed above.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>. Reading comments and answers I can suppose that the President simply misspoken. Many media today interpret this phrase exactly like in my Q — there's Schengen Area where we supposedly get visa exemption on summer 2016, and there's a list of some non-Schengen countries where the entry may also be simplified. So <em>""he's misspoken or misinterpreted; there is no other list than Annex&nbsp;II""</em> may appear to be the answer here.</p>

"How should I prepare for potential flooding in Utah and Arizona? <p>I'm planning a Southwest USA tour that can only take place in late July to early August. Roughly speaking, it's San Francisco, Yosemite, Death Valley, Las Vegas, Zion NP, Monument Valley, Grand Canyon NP, Havasupai, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I've read that this is when most rain falls, though it is a desert after all, so I'm sure <em>how much</em> rain there really is.</p>

<p>As part of this tour, I'd like to hike down into the canyons. </p>

<p>Specifically, <a href=""http://www.havasuwaterfalls.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Havasupai</a> in Arizona (a side canyon of the Grand Canyon), and <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The Narrows</a> in Zion National Park.</p>

<p>I realise that if there is heavy rain then this can lead to flash flooding, and then these canyons would be closed/ evacuated.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>As it's high season, life will be easier if I have pre-booked accommodation. Having never visited this region, though, I don't know <em>how</em> crucial this is.</p>

<p>If I pre-book everywhere and I get to the canyons, I'm kind of stuck. I can't 'skip and move on'. I know I could find an alternative for the day or two, but I'd really rather not. Another potential option is to 'save up' lost days and (doing the tour in reverse), make a detour to the Humboldt Redwoods State Park. </p>

<p>If I don't book, could I risk wasting lots of time and money finding a hotel? Note: I would consider camping for, say, half of the nights.</p>

<p>Anyway, how likely is 'rain so heavy that it prevents canyon entry' anyway? Should I really be that worried?</p>

<p>My wife submitted all the required documents including my financial documents and applied for visitor visa second time. But again they refused the visa. This time they pointed her to Appendix V 4.2 ( e ) and 4.3 ( c ).</p>

<p><em>Appendix V 4.2 The applicant must satisfy the decision maker that they are a genuine visitor. This means that the applicant:
(e) must have sufficient funds to cover all reasonable costs in relation to their visit without working or accessing public funds. This includes the cost of the return or onward journey, any costs relating to dependants, and the cost of planned activities such as private medical treatment.
Appendix V 4.3 ( c ) Funds, maintenance and accommodation provided by a third party:
V 4.3 A visitor’s travel, maintenance and accommodation may be provided by a third party where the decision maker is satisfied that they:
(c) can and will provide support to the visitor for the intended duration of their stay.</em></p>

<p>In visa application and in other documents that we provided, my wife clearly mentioned that she is travelling as a dependant and her husband (myself) will be taking care of travel, food, accommodation or any other expenses that she might need. </p>

<p>I am not sure why the visa was rejected the 2nd time even after providing all details and clear explanations. To be frank, we are not left with any documentation that we have. We submitted all documents we have. </p>

  your travel cost, support and accommodation. <strong>However you have
  presented no satisfactory evidence from them to show that they are

  accommodate yourself and any dependant adequately out of the resources
  available to you without recourse to public funds or taking
  employment; or will, with any dependants, be maintained and
  accommodated adequately by relatives or friends Finally I am not
  satisfied that you can meet the cost of the return or onward journey.

<p>So, the ECO did not consider my 3 months invoice of £1400 to my client. I have submitted my one year business bank statement so that he could see that every month £1400 is credited to my Indian account from my client in UK. </p>

<p>Also ECO thinks that my Income Tax documents that I downloaded from Income Tax office website that I submitted are not accurate.</p>

<p>Irony is I have been granted Business Visa every year based on the same documents. Even this year they have granted my business visa based on the same Income Tax Documents and same documentation. </p>

<p>If my documentation and all the documents that my wife has submitted are correct then I am sure ECO has not gone through all the documents or doesn't have knowledge about Indian Income Tax documents or Bank Statements?</p>

<p>Please help and let me know what is lacking in the documentation and documents submitted? Can my wife appeal or take legal help? </p>

<p>Myself and my wife are ready to apply for visa the 3rd time if anyone can tell us that we have missed any information. When my wife applied for visa for the 2nd time we have not left out any documentation. So, we are not sure what more documents we should submit to satisfy the visa officer. </p>
