"What are the theoretical and actual (measured) minimum water potentials in plants? <p>I'm a plant physiology researcher, but water potentials are not really my thing, so I don't have a great grasp on the literature. I'm dealing with water potential data right now though, and it seems questionable to me. Some of the measured water potential (solute + metric potentials, after lysing cells to break turgor) are as low as -48 bars (most in -10 to -35 range).</p>

<p>That would, if my math is correct, translate to a solute concentration in the 2000 mOsmol range, which seems extremely high to me. Consequently, I'm trying to determine if there is an analytic issue with the data collection. I've run through the equipment chain, checked calibrations, and everything seems ok. I've also been combing plant physiology lit. for comparable data, and I find some in that range, but I can't find any theoretical work that would help set a 'ceiling' for what constitutes a reasonable solute + metric potential.</p>

<p>So, my questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the theoretical maximum capacity for dissolved ion concentration in water, and what pressure potential would that represent, compared to pure water.</p></li>
<li><p>Is anyone aware of plant physiology research that has attempted to establish a minimum in vivo water potential in plants (either total potential, or S+M if it's broken out)?</p></li>

"Deciding a reasonable threshold for copy number variation in a CNV (SNP array) TCGA dataset <p>Is there a methodology to select a reasonable threshold for copy number variation in a CNV (SNP array) TCGA dataset, to define when there is a significative alteration?</p>

<p>Can I download CNV data for normal samples and take the 95th percentile of distribution? Are there better methods?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>This is the percentiles plot of the two distribution (Tumor vs Normal) of values, for the same technology (SNP array) and the same genome (hg19). </p>

<p>The tumor distribution has slightly more extreme values, though it is not enough in my opinion. For this reason I think I should not use a percentile score (the 5th and the 95th percentile of the normal samples distribution, for instance) to define the thresholds to call CNV alterations in the tumor samples.</p>

"All-or-nothing-law: law or general principle? <p>The all-or-nothing principle indicates that a nerve cell fires at maximum potential or not at all, based on a threshold on the stimulus.</p>

<p>Is this a statement which is always true, or only mostly-always true?</p>

<p>In electrical engineering, a discipline I have studied, we have a similar rule, a logic signal is responded to as though it is either a high or a low.  However, in the middle are what are known as ""metastable states,"" where the rules of thumb do not apply.  In fact, you can even theoretically lock up a logic circuit by presenting a steady stimulus in between two states.  Needless to say, designers of such circuits take great effort to ensure their logic is never exposed to such stimulus.</p>

<p>Do we have any evidence of neurons exhibiting behavior which defies the all-or-nothing law in some circumstances, or if not, what sorts of metastable behavior are seen when the stimulus is exceedingly close to that of the threshold?</p>

"How do plants 'tell time' for circadian rhythms based on a ~24 cycle? <p>I've read that many plants have some sort of circadian rhythm where they perform a certain action on a cycle of about 24 hours, like the mimosa plant opening and closing its leaves. Obviously this is done in order to synchronize with the sun, but many such plants continue to perform these actions even when left it constant darkness or light. It follows that this is the result of some sort of biochemical pathway, but whatever internal 'clock' is used is also independent of temperature. </p>

<p><strong>How can these plants perform certain actions every 24 hours at different temperatures when the chemical reactions most biochemical pathways use are temperature dependent?</strong></p>

<p>It would seem like the length of the cycle should vary widely according to the temperature as it affected the reactions involved, but instead it stays at a very constant length very close to 24 hours. How can this be? </p>

"How spermaceti makes a whale float <p>In the biochemistry book I'm reading (Box 10-1, Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry), an example is given in whales of how spermaceti (a wax located in the whale head), when at sea level is a liquid, and allows the whale to float due to its buoyancy. </p>

<p>As the whale dives deeper, the wax turns into a solid (due to the colder temperatures), and hence this more dense wax is less buoyant and prevents the whale from floating back up due to the greater density of the seawater at these depths.</p>

<p>My limited understanding is that density effects buoyancy in so far as that the weight of the object displaces an equivalent weight of water. If the quantity of the water displaced is small enough that the surface area of the object isn't completely submerged, it can float.</p>

<p>Now with the whale example, considering the wax is fully enclosed by the head, how would this change in local density effect the buoyancy of the whale as a whole? The weight of the wax still remains the same (in so far as the example used in the book), the only thing that changes is its density inside the whale.</p>

<p>So with a constant weight, and only a variable local density enclosed by an object (the head) and limited to these conditions only (as this is all the example in the book uses), how is this possible?</p>

approximately 31% carbohydrate by weight). The 
theoretical molecular weight is 37.9 kDa based on the 
native form, which contains 2 subunits. The α subunit 
has a molecular weight of 14.9 kDa of which 
approximately 10.2 kDa is for the polypeptide and

<p>I chill this before wrapping in egg washed puff pastry and cooking for about 40 minutes. This has resulted in rare beef, a good crisp pastry that holds its form until cutting it for serving.</p>

<p>It wasn't too wet - it just seems the pastry doesn't want to affix itself to the contents.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to improve this?</p>

"Malva pudding recipe containing too much bicarb and vinegar? <p>I tried making Malva pudding today using <a href=""http://www.woolworths.co.za/store/fragments/recipe/recipe-index.jsp?contentId=cmp101391"" rel=""nofollow"">this recipe</a> and the results were decidedly off. I don't know if it was too acidy or basey but definitely didn't taste right. The recipy calls for 2tsp bicarb and 1tbsp vinegar. I did think it was quite a bit of vinegar at the time but trusted the recipe. I assumed the bicarb/vinegar would neutralize eachother and act as a rising agent.</p>

<p>Is this a usual amount of bicarb/vinegar to use in a recipe of this size? Or did I do something else wrong?</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I didn't have jam so that was excluded but followed the recipe faithfully otherwise, fresh ingredients and all. Could the exclusion of the jam have made a diff? I didn't think it would?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>It could have been the jam! Apricot jam has a pH of 3.8ish which is what makes it preserve so well I believe. So it's possible that the jam was also supposed to neutralize the bicarb.</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>I asked about the acid base ratio at chemistry <a href=""http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24475/what-ratio-of-bicarb-to-vinegar-do-i-need-in-order-for-the-result-to-be-ph-neutr"">here</a> and almost certainly too much bicarb!</p>

"Fire side cooking <p>Last week we had a pretty strong winter storm which knocked out our power.  We have an electric stove which of course puts a cramp in cooking.  However i do have a fire place and cast iron, so i tried cooking with the fire. Haveing never done this before I decided a stew would be easiest.

"Adding Meat to Pasta Caprese <p>I absolutely love pasta caprese.  I have a great recipe for it that provides perfectly creamy mozarella and tasty tomatoes and uses up the leaves on my basil plant.  It's a great dish.</p>

<p>I also don't consider a meal without some form of protein that isn't cheese to be a meal, and vegetarian meals aren't considered kindly by those I cook for, so I really need at least some meat with every meal.</p>

<p>So my quandry is how to serve my pasta caprese as part of a meal with meat.  In the past I've done grilled chicken breast on the side, but is there a way to make it a one pot meal or serve with another meat main so I'm not limited to chicken?  Ideally I'd like to feature the flavors of the pasta as the main.</p>

"Why do we peel carrots? <p>So I was sitting there, looking down at my counter, realizing that I probably had a good carrot or two of shavings just going to waste.  (well, I'll compost it, but it's non-food at that point).</p>

<p>Is there any reason we peel carrots and don't just give them a good scrubbing?  I mean, the scrubbing works for potatoes (so long as they're not green under the skin), and carrots grow in dirt, too.  I don't think it's a pesticide issue, as we did it growing up, and I don't think we cared about pesticides back then.</p>

"How does good pasta dough feel to the touch? <p>I have just been given an Imperia Pasta Roller as a present and have wasted no time in trying to make pasta. As advised in the instruction manual, I have made a small batch of pasta just using water and passed this through the rollers in order to clean any factory impurities or debris from the machine. I noticed that the pasta (eggless I hasten to add) was quite soft, much softer than shop bought fresh pasta. I worked some more flour into the dough and the pasta held up quite well to being passed through the rollers. This was then thrown in the bin.  </p>

<p>The next batch that I made, following a recipe by Jamie Oliver, called for 100 grams of flour to 1 egg. I am using Tipo 00 flour. The resulting dough felt firmer and very slightly sticky to the touch but when cooked was very soggy and flabby in texture, not very appetising at all.</p>

<p>For my next batch I added a little extra flour and kneaded it for longer. The dough was dryer than the previous batch and when I took a few strips and put them in boiling water, they cooked perfectly. However the remainder, when I went back to it a couple of hours later had stuck to itself and turned into a solid mass that was really difficult to separate. I had dusted it with fine cornmeal to stop this happening. I was advised not to coat it in flour.</p>

<p>Can anyone please give me some advice on how the dough should feel when correctly prepared (how stiff, how moist or how sticky it should feel) and also some advice on how to stop it from forming a solid mass before I have time to cook it.</p>

"A recipe inspired by Brat cheese sauce/Cooking in Wine <p>I followed a recipe to the effect of:</p>

"How to bind chopped pepperoni, salami, and bacon <p>I have this sandwich I make that I think is pretty good, except that I have a problem with it falling apart. </p>

<p>Basically I take sliced salami, sliced pepperoni, (precooked) bacon, and banana peppers and throw them into a food processor to grind it up fairly ground up but not pasty. </p>

<p>I then put it in a skillet with some olive oil and brown/crisp it a little and then I add some red wine vinegar and black pepper to taste and set aside. </p>

<p>Then I take a loaf of french bread (there's this ""everything"" french bread at my local store that has ""everything"" seasoning on top of it, which I like to use, vs. plain french bread). I cut it in half lengthwise and scoop out some of the inside of the bread.  </p>

<p>I squirt some horseradish sauce on the bottom side, then add a layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese. Then I add heap of the meat mix, and finally top with another layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese.  </p>

<p>I then butter the skillet and press the sandwich on the skillet on each side for about a minute (like a cubano). </p>

<p>So this is one of my favorite sandwiches to make, and I think it's yummy! The problem is it's a little bit of a pain to eat, because there really isn't anything binding the meat together.</p>

<p>So I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make it not fall apart.  The first thing I tried is to shred/grate the cheese and mix it in with the meat. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. I assume it's because of the olive oil and vinegar, but I haven't tried outright removing them, as it's a crucial part of the flavor I'm going for.  </p>

<p>Next time I get a chance to make this sandwich, I was thinking maybe I would try browning the meat without adding the oil/vinegar, and instead sprinkle them on the top while building the sandwich. I figure this <em>might</em> help, but I'm not entirely sure it will completely help, since these meats are a bit fatty in their own right. </p>

<p>I was also thinking I could go the route of making it a patty (like making a hamburger patty), where I mix an egg and some breadcrumbs and cook it as a patty. I'm not so sure I really want to do that though. I'm not outright opposed to it, but I already feel like the flavor is where I want it, so I'd like to avoid throwing new flavors into the mix (though admittedly, eggs and breadcrumbs are fairly neutral).  </p>

<p>But I'm also not sure I dig the idea of a patty for this sandwich in general. I like the mouth feels of heaping mass of chopped meat, and I actually don't mind if there's <em>some</em> amount of ""fall apartness"". I just really want to reduce it a bit somehow.  </p>

<p>I'm certainly down for experimenting but I'm not by any means even fractionally rich, so I can only indulge in this pleasure about once a month or so, so I was hoping I could maybe see if anybody else out there might have any ideas?</p>

(It serves as a mastertable for information about the employees)

EmployeeId(Primary key)|Employee Designation|EmployeeName|(More columns of employee data which is not relevant to this particular query)

Table B
(It serves as table where all employees who are accounted for are stored.For eg an employee who has reported sick or is on leave or has pregnancy leave, etc.Bottom line an employee which is not available)

EmployeeID(Primary key)(Also referencing master table A as foreign key)|AccountedFor||AccountedFordurationFrom(datetime)|AccountedForDurationTo(datetime)


Table C
(It serves as a table where excused data of employees are present.For eg we have our organization's time table spread as events,1st event is morning time conference,then 2nd is silence working time,3rd is brainstorming sessions etc.Now if an employee is excused for a particular event ,it is entered here)
EmployeeID|EventCode|Excuse_DurationFrom|Excuse Duration To|Any specific Detailment

Here EmployeeID and ExcusedForEventCode are both composite primary keys as it is possible to have same employeeId for multiple excuses,but the combination is always unique.

We have built some custom attendance management system and would require the following details:

1.We need to find all those employees who are neither accounted for nor excused for a specific event(this will be provided through front end) for a time duration selected through the front end.
2.The result of the above query will subsequently be used to compare with a biometric attendance machine logs which gives 
EmployeeId|LogDate(datetime)|EventCodes as a separate table input to our database.(Mastertable A employeeId references this EmployeeId as foreign key)

It will be compared to find out true absentees for a particular event.ie All those employees who are neither accounted for,nor excuses for any particular event and who does not figure out in the biometric scan machine logs are absented for those time duration selected.We need the output of absentee like this
EmployeeId|Employee Designation|Employee Name|EventName(Have a separate table linking with EventCode)|Date&time(This would be per day per event report of employee who are absent from the selected time duration).

We have tried queries like:

select employeemastertable.employeeid,employeemastertable.Designation,employeemastertable.Name,EventCodes.EventCodeName as Eventexcusedfrom from employeemastertable inner join employeeexcusedforevents on employeemastertable.employeeid=employeeexcusedforevents.employeeid inner join EventCodes on employeeexcusedforEvents.ExcusedForEventCode=EventCodes.Eventcode left  join employeeaccountedFor on employeemastertable.employeeid=employeeaccountedFor.employeeid where employeeexcusedforevents.ExcusedForEventCode!=1(Morning conference) and employeeaccountedFor.employeeid is null;

Names have been changed

I do understand this will give those employees who does not figure out in event Morning conference but even if i do left join instead of inner join between employeemastertable and employeeexcusedForevents and put employeeexcusedforevents.excusedforeventcode is null and employeeexcusedforevents.employeeid is null,i do get all those employees not present in the other two table,but the criteria of event is not satisfied.That means what if the employee is excused for the 2nd event as well in the organization.How would i cater for that in the above code?(PS this is only the 1st part of the equation i understand that,after this i need help for the other part also,where time duration and comparing with logs is concerned)?

urgent help would be appreciated fully

"Integer 0 is found in vector calling for the -1 index? When I initialize a vector:

    std::vector <int> someVec;

and I call:

    std::cout << someVec[-1];

with an arbitrary number of elements, 0 is always returned. Is there someway to get around this? This fault in cpp is messing up my ""sort"" function. Is there anyway to initialize said vector differently in order to return the last element in the vector, rather than 0 which seems to be the default. It seems that any index called outside the range of the vector will result in 0. It isn't wrapped which is baffling me. Thanks for the help, kind stranger!

"HVAC - Circuit Board Fuse blows on AC Switch <p>I have a Honeywell System. Back in November of 2014, I replaced the Circuit Board with one by Honeywell from Amazon (1014460).

My thermostat is about 5 years old. All caps for my a/c system are no older than 2 years old.</p>

"new laminate flooring over existing hardwood, what underlayment should be used? <p>We're redoing the flooring in the whole house. We have existing hardwood which is in decent shape. a few scratches here or there that could probably be fixed. No buckling or anything. Maybe one or two spots where it feels like the floor should be nailed down again where a plank or two is loose. No noticeable squeaks or anything.</p>

<p>Pretty sure the hardwood is original to the house which means it was installed about 70 years ago. There are planks about 2 inches wide and then some that are around 4 inches. From what i can see, it looks like there's no underlayment under the existing hardwood and it was just nailed on top of the wooden subfloor. The only place that is different is the kitchen. Flooring in there had to be removed so it's down to just the bare wooden subfloor.</p>

"Can I have two storeys in a 16 foot space? <p>I'm in the process of closing on a house that has an unusually large crawlspace underneath the structure. The house is built on a relatively steep hillside and the frame of the house extends to the bottom of the hill below, giving an enclosed crawlspace.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram (with apologies for my MSPaint skills):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/J8e4G.png"" alt=""Elevation view of the house""></p>

<p>The crawlspace has approximately 4.9m (16.2 feet) of space between the concrete floor and the bottom of the timber frame supporting the ground floor. There are no stilts or other support structures in the main part of the crawlspace though there are in the other half.</p>

<p>Here's a photo on the inside:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tCN8U.jpg"" alt=""Photo showing the crawlspace""></p>

<p>I would like to have this basement finished by adding an internal staircase from the ground floor down to this area. I would like to split this space into two floors. I understand that each floor must have at least 7 feet of headroom, and I assume you'd want a foot of space between the two floors and plus another foot to account for space from the ceiling below the ground floor and the bottom floor's carpeting. That's 7+7+1+1 == 16 feet. So far so good, right?</p>

<p>During the house inspection, I asked the inspector how possible it would be to do the conversion and he said it would be impossible as you need at least 10 feet per floor, so the house is 4 feet too short to convert the crawlspace into two floors. He was also pessimistic about installing rooms (such as a toilet room or a small bedroom) on the area currently covered in black tarp. He said that converting the main area of the crawlspace (with the flat floor) is definitely possible, but I'd probably only be able to have a smaller area (with a 5 or 6-foot high ceiling, maybe) underneath the finished room suitable only as a storage area.</p>

<p>With references to suitable building regs and whatnot, is my inspector correct in saying I can only have 1 fully-finished floor, or can I still have two finished floors/storeys in the space?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One can begin by recognizing two very common characteristics of most refrigerators.
  Over a broad range of models and vintages, the operating characteristics of properly operating
  refrigerators under reasonable temperature conditions appear the same. A refrigerator turns on,
  runs for a while, turns off and is off for a while. It then turns on again and the cycle repeats. A
  typical,steady-state cycle is about 40 minutes with the duty cycle, or per cent running time, being
  about 50 percent for standard temperature differences between the food compartment of the
  refrigerator and the room in which the refrigerator is placed.
   In other words, a typical, properly
  operating refrigerator runs about 20 minutes and is off 20 minutes.</p>

"Is it ever a good strategy to not select a seat when you are in unassigned status on American Airlines? <p>So here's my not-so-hypothetical situation. My wife and I are on an American Airlines flight and for the longest leg (~6 hours) there are only ""Premium"" economy seats and crappy (single middle) seats left.</p>

<p>I just got changed to this flight because of a night-before cancellation, so I didn't even have a chance to pick a good seat from the free options despite booking this trip 2 months prior to departure.</p>

<p>So here's my theory that I'm trying to validate/invalidate. If I don't pick a seat and let them assign it at the gate, it seems like the odds improve to get a ""Premium economy"" seat. My reasoning is that if I just pick a crappy middle seat from the remaining free options, that's exactly what I'll get. However, I'm betting that they hold back premium seats hoping to get people to pay for them at the last minute, and they are more likely to be open for people without assignments on a full flight.</p>

<p>Another factor is that my wife and I bought our tickets together, I don't how hard they try to keep people who are flying together (at least couples) seated next to each other, but if they do it would reduce the odds of us getting assigned a single middle seat. </p>

"Is leaving airport at a stop before the final destination illegal? <p>There are tricks such as <a href=""http://hackmytrip.com/2012/01/introduction-to-fuel-dumping/"">""fuel dumping""</a> or <a href=""http://boardingarea.com/blogs/viewfromthewing/2012/01/07/how-to-use-hidden-city-and-throwaway-ticketing-to-save-money-on-airfare/"">""hidden city ticketing""</a> which involve booking a ticket composed of several connecting flights, then leaving the airport at a stop, possibly even ""hopping off"" a plane (intermediate landing). Rationale: Sometimes these tickets are cheaper than a ticket to one of the stops. So one adds an additional leg and discards it.</p>

<p>Some people say that when using such tricks, one enters a <em>legal gray area</em>. But I wonder:</p>

<p><em>Could leaving the airport at a stop really be illegal, i.e. violating an airline's or a travel agency's terms?</em></p>

<p>Also there are suggestions that one should not request an upgrade, because then the trick may be discovered by the airline. Here I wonder:</p>

<p><em>How can they know that one will throw away the last leg?</em></p>

"Best 'private' spots for stargazing on Mountain Teide, Tenerife <p>I'm planning travel to Tenerife in the end of May and one of the things which I like to do is do enjoy in a beautiful star scenery. I did some investigation and I concluded the best place is somewhere around the mountain Teide which is far away from resorts and therefore lights. I'll rent a car so getting there is not a problem at all. The real question is, are there any good places around or on Mountain Teide where I can drive on the night and just enjoy the stars (without telescope or similar, I'm pretty sure that I'll be shocked with my eyes also because I never saw too many stars, damn light polluting). </p>

<p>So I'm looking for good spotting places with following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If possible private spots, because I'm planning to go there with my girlfriend and want to have as much romantic mood as I can</p></li>
<li><p>Reachable by car, because I don't find it relaxing walking too much outside of the road in the middle of the night in the middle of the mountain :) I can do some walking, but not too much :)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I saw that there are many stargazing tours, but I'm looking something private for couples where we can just sit somewhere and enjoy the stars without dinner or similar experience which are offered.</p>

<p>Any other advice is welcome and if you have any suggestions just let me know. If you can reference spots on google maps or similar, that would be perfect :)</p>

"Does condition 8115 mean you can't check your work email? <p>My parents have just received their visa for their upcoming Australia trips. Among the terms, there's <a href=""http://guidesacts.fahcsia.gov.au/guides_acts/ssg/ssguide-9/ssguide-9.3/ssguide-9.3.1/ssguide-9.3.1.130.html"">condition 8115</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Condition 8115 allows 'business visitor activities' such as general business or government enquiries or negotiations, and attendance at conferences and seminars, but does not allow for work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my reading, this means that you aren't allowed to do anything else, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking your work email, or replying</li>
<li>Connecting to your work network/VPN to download documents and work on them</li>
<li>Working on work files you've brought in your computers offline</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course that sounds draconian and/or hard to impossible to enforce, but it could always come in handy as a good excuse to actually enjoy one's vacation time (and rather expensive trip).</p>

<p>Is that reading of condition 8115 correct?</p>

"Is there another destination like Thailand? <p>Last summer I stayed 7 weeks in Thailand. It was my first time in the Southeast Asia and it was one of the best trips in my life. It was a backpacker trip with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>So, next summer I want to repeat this trip but in other country in this area (Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma...) The point is which country to choose. The reasons that made this trip exceptional are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Thailand is very cheap, 10 euros per day are enough most of the days.</li>
<li>There are off the beaten track places and also touristic areas (we like to combine both).</li>
<li>Incredible beaches</li>
<li>A lot of people speak english (easy to comunicate with local people in restaurants, hostels, etc)</li>
<li>Wide variety of thai food, but also easy to find western food (sometimes we need a burger, some pasta, a sandwich...)</li>
<li>It's easy and cheap to rent a motorbike (4-5 euros)</li>
<li>The country is big enough to stay 5-7 weeks </li>
<li>Friendly native people</li>
<li>Good sanitation (I feel that if I had a problem I'll be properly treated in a hospital)</li>
</ol>

<p>Thailand travels, of course, have some points to improve (weather, wild dogs, etc) but we can live with that.</p>

"India airports post-immigration xray check purpose? <p>I've noticed that when arriving into India by air, after immigration, and after the passport stamp check to ensure you really did go through immigration, there is some sort of check where all your cabin baggage is xray'd. This is before you get to baggage claim, and before customs.</p>

<p>Cabin bags are xray'd here, and people walk through a metal detector, but jackets don't have to be taken off, nothing has to be taken out of bags before the xray, no-one seems to pay any attention to if the metal detector goes off or not, and bags which have triggered secondary checks elsewhere due to the amount of computers+cables in them sail through.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder - what is the point of this post-immigration pre-customs xray check of bags, and what are they supposed to be checking for?</p>

"How to calculate if my battery will be allowed in hand luggage? (Voltage in mAh to Wh conversion) <p>Follow-up question to <a href=""http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/42411/are-battery-packs-allowed-in-hand-luggage"">Are battery packs allowed in hand luggage?</a></p>

<p>I have a 26,000 mAh battery pack (""Intocircuit Power Castle"") which I want to take on a plane (Royal Air Maroc). Airline battery capacity limits tend to be based on Watt hours (Wh), and I'm confused about the conversion formula - specifically, the voltage part.</p>

<p>The conversion formula is <strong>mAh divided by 1,000 (or, Ah) times V = Wh</strong>. From what I can find online, V means ""operating voltage"", and this is where I get confused.</p>

<p>I can't see any reference to operating voltage on my battery. As for output voltage, there are four possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB at 5V</li>
<li>DC at 12V</li>
<li>DC at 15V</li>
<li>DC at 19V</li>
</ul>

<p>...which could give anything from 130 to 494, if any of these even <em>are</em> the operating voltage.</p>

<p>How do I find out the operating voltage to make this calculation? Or, is it possible to check based on mAh alone?</p>

"How to keep track of all things you are carrying in the luggage and where they are? <p>Often when packing for a trip, I start in a very good manner and following the <a href=""http://travel.stackexchange.com/a/3493/6997"">best techiniques available</a>.</p>
